<h1>PLAYS AND PURITANS <a name="citation3"></a><a
href="#footnote3" class="citation">[3]</a></h1>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> British Isles have been ringing
for the last few years with the word &lsquo;Art&rsquo; in its
German sense; with &lsquo;High Art,&rsquo; &lsquo;Symbolic
Art,&rsquo; &lsquo;Ecclesiastical Art,&rsquo; &lsquo;Dramatic
Art,&rsquo; &lsquo;Tragic Art,&rsquo; and so forth; and every
well-educated person is expected, nowadays, to know something
about Art.&nbsp; Yet in spite of all translations of German
&lsquo;&AElig;sthetic&rsquo; treatises, and
&lsquo;Kunstnovellen,&rsquo; the mass of the British people cares
very little about the matter, and sits contented under the
imputation of &lsquo;bad taste.&rsquo;&nbsp; Our stage, long
since dead, does not revive; our poetry is dying; our music, like
our architecture, only reproduces the past; our painting is only
first-rate when it handles landscapes and animals, and seems
likely so to remain; but, meanwhile, nobody cares.&nbsp; Some of
the deepest and most earnest minds vote the question, in general,
a &lsquo;sham and a snare,&rsquo; and whisper to each other
confidentially, that Gothic art is beginning to be a
&lsquo;bore,&rsquo; and that Sir Christopher Wren was a very good
fellow after all; while the middle classes look on the Art
movement half amused, as with a pretty toy, half sulkily
suspicious of Popery and Paganism, and think, apparently, that
Art is very well when it means nothing, and is merely used to
beautify drawing-rooms and shawl patterns; not to mention that,
if there were no painters, Mr. Smith could not hand down to
posterity likenesses of himself, Mrs. Smith, and family.&nbsp;
But when &lsquo;Art&rsquo; dares to be in earnest, and to mean
something, much more to connect itself with religion,
Smith&rsquo;s tone alters.&nbsp; He will teach &lsquo;Art&rsquo;
to keep in what he considers its place, and if it refuses, take
the law of it, and put it into the Ecclesiastical Court.&nbsp; So
he says, and what is more, he means what he says; and as all the
world, from Hindostan to Canada, knows by most practical proof,
what he means, he sooner or later does, perhaps not always in the
wisest way, but still he does it.</p>
<p>Thus, in fact, the temper of the British nation toward
&lsquo;Art&rsquo; is simply that of the old Puritans, softened,
no doubt, and widened, but only enough so as to permit Art, not
to encourage it.</p>
<p>Some men&rsquo;s thoughts on this curious fact would probably
take the form of some &aelig;sthetic <i>&agrave; priori</i>
disquisition, beginning with &lsquo;the tendency of the infinite
to reveal itself in the finite,&rsquo; and ending&mdash;who can
tell where?&nbsp; But as we cannot honestly arrogate to ourselves
any skill in the <i>scientia scientiarum</i>, or say, &lsquo;The
Lord possessed me in the beginning of His way, before His works
of old.&nbsp; When He prepared the heavens, I was there, when He
set a compass upon the face of the deep;&rsquo; we shall leave
&aelig;sthetic science to those who think that they comprehend
it; we shall, as simple disciples of Bacon, deal with facts and
with history as &lsquo;the will of God revealed in
facts.&rsquo;&nbsp; We will leave those who choose to settle what
ought to be, and ourselves look patiently at that which actually
was once, and which may be again; that so out of the conduct of
our old Puritan forefathers (right or wrong), and their long war
against &lsquo;Art,&rsquo; we may learn a wholesome lesson; as we
doubtless shall, if we believe firmly that our history is neither
more nor less than what the old Hebrew prophets called
&lsquo;God&rsquo;s gracious dealings with his people,&rsquo; and
not say in our hearts, like some sentimental girl who sings
Jacobite ballads (written forty years ago by men who cared no
more for the Stuarts than for the Ptolemies, and were ready to
kiss the dust off George the Fourth&rsquo;s feet at his visit to
Edinburgh)&mdash;&lsquo;Victrix causa Diis placuit, sed victa
puellis.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The historian of a time of change has always a difficult and
invidious task.&nbsp; For Revolutions, in the great majority of
cases, arise not merely from the crimes of a few great men, but
from a general viciousness and decay of the whole, or the
majority, of the nation; and that viciousness is certain to be
made up, in great part, of a loosening of domestic ties, of
breaches of the Seventh Commandment, and of sins connected with
them, which a writer is now hardly permitted to mention.&nbsp; An
&lsquo;evil and adulterous generation&rsquo; has been in all ages
and countries the one marked out for intestine and internecine
strife.&nbsp; That description is always applicable to a
revolutionary generation; whether or not it also comes under the
class of a superstitious one, &lsquo;seeking after a sign from
heaven,&rsquo; only half believing its own creed, and, therefore,
on tiptoe for miraculous confirmations of it, at the same time
that it fiercely persecutes any one who, by attempting innovation
or reform, seems about to snatch from weak faith the last plank
which keeps it from sinking into the abyss.&nbsp; In describing
such an age, the historian lies under this paradoxical
disadvantage, that his case is actually too strong for him to
state it.&nbsp; If he tells the whole truth, the easy-going and
respectable multitude, in easy-going and respectable days like
these, will either shut their ears prudishly to his painful
facts, or reject them as incredible, unaccustomed as they are to
find similar horrors and abominations among people of their own
rank, of whom they are naturally inclined to judge by their own
standard of civilisation.&nbsp; Thus if any one, in justification
of the Reformation and the British hatred of Popery during the
sixteenth century, should dare to detail the undoubted facts of
the Inquisition, and to comment on them dramatically enough to
make his readers feel about them what men who witnessed them
felt, he would be accused of a &lsquo;morbid love of
horrors.&rsquo;&nbsp; If any one, in order to show how the French
Revolution of 1793 was really God&rsquo;s judgment on the
profligacy of the <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i>, were to paint that
profligacy as the men of the <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i>
unblushingly painted it themselves, respectability would have a
right to demand, &lsquo;How dare you, sir, drag such disgusting
facts from their merited oblivion?&rsquo;&nbsp; Those, again, who
are really acquainted with the history of Henry the
Eighth&rsquo;s marriages, are well aware of facts which prove him
to have been, not a man of violent and lawless passions, but of a
cold temperament and a scrupulous conscience; but which cannot be
stated in print, save in the most delicate and passing hints, to
be taken only by those who at once understand such matters, and
really wish to know the truth; while young ladies in general will
still look on Henry as a monster in human form, because no one
dares, or indeed ought, to undeceive them by anything beyond bare
assertion without proof.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But what does it matter,&rsquo; some one may say,
&lsquo;what young ladies think about history?&rsquo;&nbsp; This
it matters; that these young ladies will some day be mothers, and
as such will teach their children their own notions of modern
history; and that, as long as men confine themselves to the
teaching of Roman and Greek history, and leave the history of
their own country to be handled exclusively by their unmarried
sisters, so long will slanders, superstitions, and false
political principles be perpetuated in the minds of our boys and
girls.</p>
<p>But a still worse evil arises from the fact that the
historian&rsquo;s case is often too strong to be stated.&nbsp;
There is always a reactionary party, or one at least which
lingers sentimentally over the dream of past golden ages, such as
that of which Cowley says, with a sort of na&iuml;ve blasphemy,
at which one knows not whether to smile or sigh&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;When God, the cause to me and men
unknown,<br />
Forsook the royal houses, and his own.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These have full liberty to say all they can in praise of the
defeated system; but the historian has no such liberty to state
the case against it.&nbsp; If he even asserts that he has
counter-facts, but dare not state them, he is at once met with a
<i>pr&aelig;judicium</i>.&nbsp; The mere fact of his having
ascertained the truth is imputed as a blame to him, in a sort of
prudish cant.&nbsp; &lsquo;What a very improper person he must be
to like to dabble in such improper books that they must not even
be quoted.&rsquo;&nbsp; If in self-defence he desperately gives
his facts, he only increases the feeling against him, whilst the
reactionists, hiding their blushing faces, find in their modesty
an excuse for avoiding the truth; if, on the other hand, he
content himself with bare assertion, and with indicating the
sources from whence his conclusions are drawn, what care the
reactionists?&nbsp; They know well that the public will not take
the trouble to consult manuscripts, State papers, pamphlets, rare
biographies, but will content themselves with ready-made history;
and they therefore go on unblushing to republish their old
romance, leaving poor truth, after she has been painfully haled
up to the well&rsquo;s mouth, to tumble miserably to the bottom
of it again.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In the face of this danger we will go on to say as much as we
dare of the great cause, Puritans <i>v.</i> Players, before our
readers, trusting to find some of them at least sufficiently
unacquainted with the common notions on the point to form a fair
decision.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>What those notions are is well known.&nbsp; Very many of her
Majesty&rsquo;s subjects are of opinion that the first half of
the seventeenth century (if the Puritans had not interfered and
spoilt all) was the most beautiful period of the English
nation&rsquo;s life; that in it the chivalry and ardent piety of
the Middle Age were happily combined with modern art and
civilisation; that the Puritan hatred of the Court, of
stage-plays, of the fashions of the time, was only &lsquo;a
scrupulous and fantastical niceness&rsquo;; barbaric and
tasteless, if sincere; if insincere, the basest hypocrisy; that
the stage-plays, though coarse, were no worse than Shakspeare,
whom everybody reads; and that if the Stuarts patronised the
stage they also raised it, and exercised a purifying
censorship.&nbsp; And many more who do not go all these lengths
with the reactionists, and cannot make up their mind to look to
the Stuart reigns either for model churchmen or model courtiers,
are still inclined to sneer at the Puritan
&lsquo;preciseness,&rsquo; and to say lazily, that though, of
course, something may have been wrong, yet there was no need to
make such a fuss about the matter; and that at all events the
Puritans were men of very bad taste.</p>
<p>Mr. Gifford, in his introduction to Massinger&rsquo;s plays
(1813), was probably the spokesman of his own generation,
certainly of a great part of this generation also, when he
informs us, that &lsquo;with Massinger terminated the triumph of
dramatic poetry; indeed, the stage itself survived him but a
short time.&nbsp; The nation was convulsed to its centre by
contending factions, and a set of austere and gloomy fanatics,
enemies to every elegant amusement and every social relaxation,
rose upon the ruins of the State.&nbsp; Exasperated by the
ridicule with which they had long been covered by the stage, they
persecuted the actors with unrelenting severity, and consigned
them, together with the writers, to hopeless obscurity and
wretchedness.&nbsp; Taylor died in the extreme of poverty,
Shirley opened a little school at Brentford, and Downe, the boast
of the stage, kept an ale-house at Brentford.&nbsp; Others, and
those the far greater number, joined the royal standard, and
exerted themselves with more gallantry than good fortune in the
service of their old and indulgent master.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have not yet, perhaps, fully estimated, and
certainly not yet fully recovered, what was lost in that
unfortunate struggle.&nbsp; The arts were rapidly advancing to
perfection under the fostering wing of a monarch who united in
himself taste to feel, spirit to undertake, and munificence to
reward.&nbsp; Architecture, painting, and poetry were by turns
the objects of his paternal care.&nbsp; Shakspeare was his
&ldquo;closet companion,&rdquo; Jonson his poet, and in
conjunction with Inigo Jones, his favoured architect, produced
those magnificent entertainments,&rsquo; etc.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>He then goes on to account for the supposed sudden fall of
dramatic art at the Restoration, by the somewhat far-fetched
theory that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Such was the horror created in the general
mind by the perverse and unsocial government from which they had
so fortunately escaped, that the people appear to have anxiously
avoided all retrospect, and, with Prynne and Vicars, to have lost
sight of Shakspeare and &ldquo;his fellows.&rdquo;&nbsp; Instead,
therefore, of taking up dramatic poetry where it abruptly ceased
in the labours of Massinger, they elicited, as it were, a manner
of their own, or fetched it from the heavy monotony of their
continental neighbours.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So is history written, and, what is more, believed.&nbsp; The
amount of misrepresentation in this passage (which would probably
pass current with most readers in the present day) is quite
ludicrous.&nbsp; In the first place, it will hardly be believed
that these words occur in an essay which, after extolling
Massinger as one of the greatest poets of his age, second,
indeed, only to Shakspeare, also informs us (and, it seems, quite
truly) that, so far from having been really appreciated or
patronised, he maintained a constant struggle with
adversity,&mdash;&lsquo;that even the bounty of his particular
friends, on which he chiefly relied, left him in a state of
absolute dependence,&rsquo;&mdash;that while &lsquo;other writers
for the stage had their periods of good fortune, Massinger seems
to have enjoyed no gleam of sunshine; his life was all one misty
day, and &ldquo;shadows, clouds, and darkness rested on
it.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>So much for Charles&rsquo;s patronage of a really great
poet.&nbsp; What sort of men he did patronise, practically and in
earnest, we shall see hereafter, when we come to speak of Mr.
Shirley.</p>
<p>But Mr. Gifford must needs give an instance to prove that
Charles was &lsquo;not inattentive to the success of
Massinger,&rsquo; and a curious one it is; of the same class,
unfortunately, as that with the man in the old story, who
recorded with pride that the King had spoken to him,
and&mdash;had told him to get out of the way.</p>
<p>Massinger in his &lsquo;King and the Subject&rsquo; had
introduced Don Pedro of Spain thus speaking&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Monies!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll raise supplies
which way we please,<br />
And force you to subscribe to blanks, in which<br />
We&rsquo;ll mulct you as we shall think fit.&nbsp; The
C&aelig;sars<br />
In Rome were wise, acknowledging no law<br />
But what their swords did ratify, the wives<br />
And daughters of the senators bowing to<br />
Their will, as deities,&rsquo; etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Against which passage Charles, reading over the play before he
allowed of it, had written, &lsquo;This is too insolent, and not
to be printed.&rsquo;&nbsp; Too insolent it certainly was,
considering the state of public matters in the year 1638.&nbsp;
It would be interesting enough to analyse the reasons which made
Charles dislike in the mouth of Pedro sentiments so very like his
own; but we must proceed, only pointing out the way in which men,
determined to repeat the traditional clap-trap about the Stuarts,
are actually blind to the meaning of the very facts which they
themselves quote.</p>
<p>Where, then, do the facts of history contradict Mr.
Gifford?</p>
<p>We believe that, so far from the triumph of dramatic poetry
terminating with Massinger, dramatic art had been steadily
growing worse from the first years of James; that instead of the
arts advancing to perfection under Charles the First, they
steadily deteriorated in quality, though the supply became more
abundant; that so far from there having been a sudden change for
the worse in the drama after the Restoration, the taste of the
courts of Charles the First and of Charles the Second are
indistinguishable; that the court poets, and probably the actors
also, of the early part of Charles the Second&rsquo;s reign had
many of them belonged to the court of Charles the First, as did
Davenant, the Duke and Duchess of Newcastle, Fanshaw, and Shirley
himself; that the common notion of a &lsquo;new manner&rsquo;
having been introduced from France after the Restoration, or
indeed having come in at all, is not founded on fact, the only
change being that the plays of Charles the Second&rsquo;s time
were somewhat more stupid, and that while five of the seven
deadly sins had always had free licence on the stage, blasphemy
and profane swearing were now enfranchised to fill up the
seven.&nbsp; As for the assertion that the new manner (supposing
it to have existed) was imported from France, there is far more
reason to believe that the French copied us than we them, and
that if they did not learn from Charles the First&rsquo;s poets
the superstition of &lsquo;the three unities,&rsquo; they at
least learnt to make ancient kings and heroes talk and act like
seventeenth century courtiers, and to exchange their old clumsy
masques and translations of Italian and Spanish farces for a
comedy depicting native scoundrelism.&nbsp; Probably enough,
indeed, the great and sudden development of the French stage,
which took place in the middle of the seventeenth century under
Corneille and Moli&egrave;re, was excited by the English cavalier
playwrights who took refuge in France.</p>
<p>No doubt, as Mr. Gifford says, the Puritans were exasperated
against the stage-players by the insults heaped on them; but the
cause of quarrel lay far deeper than any such personal
soreness.&nbsp; The Puritans had attacked the players before the
players meddled with them, and that on principle; with what
justification must be considered hereafter.&nbsp; But the fact is
(and this seems to have been, like many other facts, conveniently
forgotten), that the Puritans were by no means alone in their
protest against the stage, and that the war was not begun
exclusively by them.&nbsp; As early as the latter half of the
sixteenth century, not merely Northbrooke, Gosson, Stubs, and
Reynolds had lifted up their voices against them, but Archbishop
Parker, Bishop Babington, Bishop Hall, and the author of the
<i>Mirror for Magistrates</i>.&nbsp; The University of Oxford, in
1584, had passed a statute forbidding common plays and players in
the university, on the very same moral grounds on which the
Puritans objected to them.&nbsp; The city of London, in 1580, had
obtained from the Queen the suppression of plays on Sundays; and
not long after, &lsquo;considering that play-houses and
dicing-houses were traps for young gentlemen and others,&rsquo;
obtained leave from the Queen and Privy Council to thrust the
players out of the city, and to pull down the play-houses, five
in number; and, paradoxical as it may seem, there is little doubt
that, by the letter of the law, &lsquo;stage plays and
enterludes&rsquo; were, even to the end of Charles the
First&rsquo;s reign, &lsquo;unlawful pastime,&rsquo; being
forbidden by 14 Eliz., 39 Eliz., 1 Jacobi, 3 Jacobi, and 1
Caroli, and the players subject to severe punishment as
&lsquo;rogues and vagabonds.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Act of 1 Jacobi
seems even to have gone so far as to repeal the clauses which, in
Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, had allowed companies of players the
protection of a &lsquo;baron or honourable person of greater
degree,&rsquo; who might &lsquo;authorise them to play under his
hand and seal of arms.&rsquo;&nbsp; So that the Puritans were
only demanding of the sovereigns that they should enforce the
very laws which they themselves had made, and which they and
their nobles were setting at defiance.&nbsp; Whether the plays
ought to have been put down, and whether the laws were necessary,
is a different question; but certainly the court and the
aristocracy stood in the questionable, though too common,
position of men who made laws which prohibited to the poor
amusements in which they themselves indulged without
restraint.</p>
<p>But were these plays objectionable?&nbsp; As far as the
comedies are concerned, that will depend on the answer to the
question, Are plays objectionable, the staple subject of which is
adultery?&nbsp; Now, we cannot but agree with the Puritans, that
adultery is not a subject for comedy at all.&nbsp; It may be for
tragedy; but for comedy never.&nbsp; It is a sin; not merely
theologically, but socially, one of the very worst sins, the
parent of seven other sins,&mdash;of falsehood, suspicion, hate,
murder, and a whole bevy of devils.&nbsp; The prevalence of
adultery in any country has always been a sign and a cause of
social insincerity, division, and revolution; where a people has
learnt to connive and laugh at it, and to treat it as a light
thing, that people has been always careless, base, selfish,
cowardly,&mdash;ripe for slavery.&nbsp; And we must say that
either the courtiers and Londoners of James and Charles the First
were in that state, or that the poets were doing their best to
make them so.</p>
<p>We shall not shock our readers by any details on this point;
we shall only say that there is hardly a comedy of the
seventeenth century, with the exception of Shakspeare&rsquo;s, in
which adultery is not introduced as a subject of laughter, and
often made the staple of the whole plot.&nbsp; The seducer is, if
not openly applauded, at least let to pass as a &lsquo;handsome
gentleman&rsquo;; the injured husband is, as in that Italian
literature of which we shall speak shortly, the object of every
kind of scorn and ridicule.&nbsp; In this latter habit (common to
most European nations) there is a sort of justice.&nbsp; A man
can generally retain his wife&rsquo;s affections if he will
behave himself like a man; and &lsquo;injured husbands&rsquo;
have for the most part no one to blame but themselves.&nbsp; But
the matter is not a subject for comedy; not even in that case
which has been always too common in France, Italy, and the Romish
countries, and which seems to have been painfully common in
England in the seventeenth century, when, by a <i>mariage de
convenance</i>, a young girl is married up to a rich idiot or a
decrepit old man.&nbsp; Such things are not comedies, but
tragedies; subjects for pity and for silence, not for brutal
ribaldry.&nbsp; Therefore the men who look on them in the light
which the Stuart dramatists looked are not good men, and do no
good service to the country; especially when they erect adultery
into a science, and seem to take a perverse pleasure in teaching
their audience every possible method, accident, cause, and
consequence of it; always, too, when they have an opportunity,
pointing &lsquo;Eastward Ho!&rsquo; <i>i.e.</i> to the city of
London, as the quarter where court gallants can find boundless
indulgence for their passions amid the fair wives of dull and
cowardly citizens.&nbsp; If the citizens drove the players out of
London, the playwrights took good care to have their
revenge.&nbsp; The citizen is their standard butt.&nbsp; These
shallow parasites, and their shallower sovereigns, seem to have
taken a perverse and, as it happened, a fatal pleasure in
insulting them.&nbsp; Sad it is to see in Shirley&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Gamester,&rsquo; Charles the First&rsquo;s favourite play,
a passage like that in Act i. Scene 1, where old Barnacle
proclaims, unblushing, his own shame and that of his
fellow-merchants.&nbsp; Surely, if Charles ever could have
repented of any act of his own, he must have repented, in many a
humiliating after-passage with that same city of London, of
having given those base words his royal warrant and
approbation.</p>
<p>The tragedies of the seventeenth century are, on the whole, as
questionable as the comedies.&nbsp; That there are noble plays
among them here and there, no one denies&mdash;any more than that
there are exquisitely amusing plays among the comedies; but as
the staple interest of the comedies is dirt, so the staple
interest of the tragedies is crime.&nbsp; Revenge, hatred,
villany, incest, and murder upon murder are their constant
themes, and (with the exception of Shakspeare, Ben Jonson in his
earlier plays, and perhaps Massinger) they handle these horrors
with little or no moral purpose, save that of exciting and
amusing the audience, and of displaying their own power of
delineation in a way which makes one but too ready to believe the
accusations of the Puritans (supported as they are by many ugly
anecdotes) that the play-writers and actors were mostly men of
fierce and reckless lives, who had but too practical an
acquaintance with the dark passions which they sketch.&nbsp; This
is notoriously the case with most of the French novelists of the
modern &lsquo;Literature of Horror,&rsquo; and the two
literatures are morally identical.&nbsp; We do not know of a
complaint which can be justly brought against the School of
Balzac and Dumas which will not equally apply to the average
tragedy of the whole period preceding the civil wars.</p>
<p>This public appetite for horrors, for which they catered so
greedily, tempted them toward another mistake, which brought upon
them (and not undeservedly) heavy odium.</p>
<p>One of the worst counts against Dramatic Art (as well as
against Pictorial) was the simple fact that it came from
Italy.&nbsp; We must fairly put ourselves into the position of an
honest Englishman of the seventeenth century before we can
appreciate the huge <i>pr&aelig;judicium</i> which must needs
have arisen in his mind against anything which could claim a
Transalpine parentage.&nbsp; Italy was then not merely the
stronghold of Popery.&nbsp; That in itself would have been a fair
reason for others beside Puritans saying, &lsquo;If the root be
corrupt, the fruit will be also: any expression of Italian
thought and feeling must be probably unwholesome while her vitals
are being eaten out by an abominable falsehood, only half
believed by the masses, and not believed at all by the higher
classes, even those of the priesthood; but only kept up for their
private aggrandisement.&rsquo;&nbsp; But there was more than
hypothesis in favour of the men who might say this; there was
universal, notorious, shocking fact.&nbsp; It was a fact that
Italy was the centre where sins were invented worthy of the doom
of the Cities of the Plain, and from whence they spread to all
nations who had connection with her.&nbsp; We dare give no proof
of this assertion.&nbsp; The Italian morals and the Italian
lighter literature of the sixteenth and of the beginning of the
seventeenth century were such, that one is almost ashamed to
confess that one has looked into them, although the painful task
is absolutely necessary for one who wishes to understand either
the European society of the time or the Puritan hatred of the
drama.&nbsp; <i>Non ragionam di lor: ma guarda &egrave;
passa</i>.</p>
<p>It is equally a fact that these vices were imported into
England by the young men who, under pretence of learning the
Italian polish, travelled to Italy.&nbsp; From the days of
Gabriel Harvey and Lord Oxford, about the middle of
Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, this foul tide had begun to set toward
England, gaining an additional coarseness and frivolity in
passing through the French Court (then an utter Gehenna) in its
course hitherward; till, to judge by Marston&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Satires,&rsquo; certain members of the higher classes had,
by the beginning of James&rsquo;s reign, learnt nearly all which
the Italians had to teach them.&nbsp; Marston writes in a rage,
it is true; foaming, stamping, and vapouring too much to escape
the suspicion of exaggeration; yet he dared not have published
the things which he does, had he not fair ground for some at
least of his assertions.&nbsp; And Marston, be it remembered, was
no Puritan, but a playwright, and Ben Jonson&rsquo;s friend.</p>
<p>Bishop Hall, in his &lsquo;Satires,&rsquo; describes things
bad enough, though not so bad as Marston does; but what is even
more to the purpose, he wrote, and dedicated to James, a long
dissuasive against the fashion of running abroad.&nbsp; Whatever
may be thought of the arguments of &lsquo;Quo vadis?&mdash;a
Censure of Travel,&rsquo; its main drift is clear enough.&nbsp;
Young gentlemen, by going to Italy, learnt to be fops and
profligates, and probably Papists into the bargain.&nbsp; These
assertions there is no denying.&nbsp; Since the days of Lord
Oxford, most of the ridiculous and expensive fashions in dress
had come from Italy, as well as the newest modes of sin; and the
playwrights themselves make no secret of the fact.&nbsp; There is
no need to quote instances; they are innumerable; and the most
serious are not fit to be quoted, scarcely the titles of the
plays in which they occur; but they justify almost every line of
Bishop Hall&rsquo;s questions (of which some of the strongest
expressions have necessarily been omitted):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;What mischief have we among us which we
have not borrowed?</p>
<p>&lsquo;To begin at our skin: who knows not whence we had the
variety of our vain disguises?&nbsp; As if we had not wit enough
to be foolish unless we were taught it.&nbsp; These dresses,
being constant in their mutability, show us our masters.&nbsp;
What is it that we have not learned of our neighbours, save only
to be proud good-cheap? whom would it not vex to see how that the
other sex hath learned to make anticks and monsters of
themselves?&nbsp; Whence come their (absurd fashions); but the
one from some ill-shaped dame of France, the other from the
worse-minded courtesans of Italy?&nbsp; Whence else learned they
to daub these mud-walls with apothecaries&rsquo; mortar; and
those high washes, which are so cunningly licked on that the wet
napkin of Phryne should he deceived?&nbsp; Whence the frizzled
and powdered bushes of their borrowed hair?&nbsp; As if they were
ashamed of the head of God&rsquo;s making, and proud of the
tire-woman&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Where learned we that devilish art and
practice of duel, wherein men seek honour in blood, and are
taught the ambition of being glorious butchers of men?&nbsp;
Where had we that luxurious delicacy in our feasts, in which the
nose is no less pleased than the palate, and the eye no less than
either? wherein the piles of dishes make barricadoes against the
appetite, and with a pleasing encumbrance trouble a hungry
guest.&nbsp; Where those forms of ceremonious quaffing, in which
men have learned to make gods of others and beasts of themselves,
and lose their reason while they pretend to do reason?&nbsp;
Where the lawlessness (miscalled freedom) of a wild tongue, that
runs, with reins on the neck, through the bedchambers of princes,
their closets, their council tables, and spares not the very
cabinet of their breasts, much less can be barred out of the most
retired secrecy of inferior greatness?&nbsp; Where the change of
noble attendance and hospitality into four wheels and some few
butterflies?&nbsp; Where the art of dishonesty in practical
Machiavelism, in false equivocations?&nbsp; Where the slight
account of that filthiness which is but condemned as venial, and
tolerated as not unnecessary?&nbsp; Where the skill of civil and
honourable hypocrisy in those formal compliments which do neither
expect belief from others nor carry any from ourselves?&nbsp;
Where&rsquo; (and here Bishop Hall begins to speak concerning
things on which we must be silent, as of matters notorious and
undeniable.)&nbsp; &lsquo;Where that close Atheism, which
secretly laughs God in the face, and thinks it weakness to
believe, wisdom to profess any religion?&nbsp; Where the bloody
and tragical science of king-killing, the new divinity of
disobedience and rebellion? with too many other evils, wherewith
foreign conversation hath endangered the infection of our
peace?&rsquo;&mdash;Bishop Hall&rsquo;s &lsquo;Quo Vadis, or a
Censure of Travel,&rsquo; vol xii. sect. 22.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Add to these a third plain fact, that Italy was the
mother-country of the drama, where it had thriven with wonderful
fertility ever since the beginning of the sixteenth
century.&nbsp; However much truth there may be in the common
assertion that the old &lsquo;miracle plays&rsquo; and
&lsquo;mysteries&rsquo; were the parents of the English drama (as
they certainly were of the Spanish and the Italian), we have yet
to learn how much our stage owed, from its first rise under
Elizabeth, to direct importations from Italy.&nbsp; This is
merely thrown out as a suggestion; to establish the fact would
require a wide acquaintance with the early Italian drama;
meanwhile, let two patent facts have their due weight.&nbsp; The
names of the characters in most of our early regular comedies are
Italian; so are the scenes; and so, one hopes, are the manners,
at least they profess to be so.&nbsp; Next, the plots of many of
the dramas are notoriously taken from the Italian novelists; and
if Shakspeare (who had a truly divine instinct for finding honey
where others found poison) went to Cinthio for
&lsquo;Othello&rsquo; and &lsquo;Measure for Measure,&rsquo; to
Bandello for &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet,&rsquo; and to Boccaccio for
&lsquo;Cymbeline,&rsquo; there were plenty of other playwrights
who would go to the same sources for worse matter, or at least
catch from these profligate writers somewhat of their Italian
morality, which exalts adultery into a virtue, seduction into a
science, and revenge into a duty; which revels in the horrible as
freely as any French novelist of the romantic school; and whose
only value is its pitiless exposure of the profligacy of the
Romish priesthood: if an exposure can be valuable which makes a
mock equally of things truly and falsely sacred, and leaves on
the reader&rsquo;s mind the fear that the writer saw nothing in
heaven or earth worthy of belief, respect, or self-sacrifice,
save personal enjoyment.</p>
<p>Now this is the morality of the Italian novelists; and to
judge from their vivid sketches (which, they do not scruple to
assert, were drawn from life, and for which they give names,
places, and all details which might amuse the noble gentlemen and
ladies to whom these stories are dedicated), this had been the
morality of Italy for some centuries past.&nbsp; This, also, is
the general morality of the English stage in the seventeenth
century.&nbsp; Can we wonder that thinking men should have seen a
connection between Italy and the stage?&nbsp; Certainly the
playwrights put themselves between the horns of an ugly
dilemma.&nbsp; Either the vices which they depicted were those of
general English society, and of themselves also (for they lived
in the very heart of town and court foppery); or else they were
the vices of a foreign country, with which the English were
comparatively unacquainted.&nbsp; In the first case, we can only
say that the Stuart age in England was one which deserved
purgation of the most terrible kind, and to get rid of which the
severest and most abnormal measures would have been not only
justifiable, but, to judge by the experience of all history,
necessary; for extraordinary diseases never have been, and never
will be, eradicated save by extraordinary medicines.&nbsp; In the
second case, the playwrights were wantonly defiling the minds of
the people, and, instead of &lsquo;holding up a mirror to
vice,&rsquo; instructing frail virtue in vices which she had not
learned, and fully justifying old Prynne&rsquo;s indignant
complaint&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The acting of foreign, obsolete, and long
since forgotten villanies on the stage, is so far from working a
detestation of them in the spectators&rsquo; minds (who,
perchance, were utterly ignorant of them, till they were
acquainted with them at the play-house, and so needed no
dehortation from them), that it often excites dangerous dunghill
spirits, who have nothing in them for to make them eminent, to
reduce them into practice, of purpose to perpetuate their
spurious ill-serving memories to posterity, leastwise in some
tragic interlude.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That Prynne spoke herein nought but sober sense, our own
police reports will sufficiently prove.&nbsp; It is notorious
that the representation in our own days of &lsquo;Tom and
Jerry&rsquo; and of &lsquo;Jack Sheppard&rsquo; did excite dozens
of young lads to imitate the heroes of those dramas; and such
must have been the effect of similar and worse representations in
the Stuart age.&nbsp; No rational man will need the authority of
Bishop Babington, Doctor Leighton, Archbishop Parker, Purchas,
Sparkes, Reynolds, White, or any one else, Churchman or Puritan,
prelate or &lsquo;penitent reclaimed play-poet,&rsquo; like
Stephen Gosson, to convince him that, as they assert,
citizens&rsquo; wives (who are generally represented as the
proper subjects for seduction) &lsquo;have, even on their
deathbeds, with tears confessed that they have received, at these
spectacles, such evil infections as have turned their minds from
chaste cogitations, and made them, of honest women, light
huswives; . . . have brought their husbands into contempt, their
children into question, . . . and their souls into the assault of
a dangerous state;&rsquo; or that &lsquo;The devices of carrying
and re-carrying letters by laundresses, practising with pedlars
to transport their tokens by colourable means to sell their
merchandise, and other kinds of policies to beguile fathers of
their children, husbands of their wives, guardians of their
wards, and masters of their servants, were aptly taught in these
schools of abuse.&rsquo; <a name="citation27a"></a><a
href="#footnote27a" class="citation">[27a]</a></p>
<p>The matter is simple enough.&nbsp; We should not allow these
plays to be acted in our own day, because we know that they would
produce their effects.&nbsp; We should call him a madman who
allowed his daughters or his servants to see such
representations. <a name="citation27b"></a><a href="#footnote27b"
class="citation">[27b]</a>&nbsp; Why, in all fairness, were the
Puritans wrong in condemning that which we now have absolutely
forbidden?</p>
<p>We will go no further into the details of the licentiousness
of the old play-houses.&nbsp; Gosson and his colleague the
anonymous Penitent assert them, as does Prynne, to have been not
only schools but antechambers to houses of a worse kind, and that
the lessons learned in the pit were only not practised also in
the pit.&nbsp; What reason have we to doubt it, who know that
till Mr. Macready commenced a practical reformation of this
abuse, for which his name will be ever respected, our own
comparatively purified stage was just the same?&nbsp; Let any one
who remembers the saloons of Drury Lane and Covent Garden thirty
years ago judge for himself what the accessories of the Globe or
the Fortune must have been, in days when players were allowed to
talk inside as freely as the public behaved outside.</p>
<p>Not that the poets or the players had any conscious intention
of demoralising their hearers, any more than they had of
correcting them.&nbsp; We will lay on them the blame of no
special <i>malus animus</i>: but, at the same time, we must treat
their fine words about &lsquo;holding a mirror up to vice,&rsquo;
and &lsquo;showing the age its own deformity,&rsquo; as mere
cant, which the men themselves must have spoken tongue in
cheek.&nbsp; It was as much an insincere cant in those days as it
was when, two generations later, Jeremy Collier exposed its
falsehood in the mouth of Congreve.&nbsp; If the poets had really
intended to show vice its own deformity, they would have
represented it (as Shakspeare always does) as punished, and not
as triumphant.&nbsp; It is ridiculous to talk of moral purpose in
works in which there is no moral justice.&nbsp; The only
condition which can excuse the representation of evil is
omitted.&nbsp; The simple fact is that the poets wanted to draw a
house; that this could most easily be done by the coarsest and
most violent means; and that not being often able to find stories
exciting enough in the past records of sober English society,
they went to Italy and Spain for the violent passions and wild
crimes of southern temperaments, excited, and yet left lawless,
by a superstition believed in enough to darken and brutalise, but
not enough to control, its victims.&nbsp; Those were the
countries which just then furnished that strange mixture of
inward savagery with outward civilisation, which is the immoral
playwright&rsquo;s fittest material; because, while the inward
savagery moves the passions of the audience, the outward
civilisation brings the character near enough to them to give
them a likeness of themselves in their worst moments, such as no
&lsquo;Mystery of Cain&rsquo; or &lsquo;Tragedy of
Prometheus&rsquo; can give.</p>
<p>Does this seem too severe in the eyes of those who value the
drama for its lessons in human nature?&nbsp; On that special
point something must be said hereafter.&nbsp; Meanwhile, hear one
of the sixteenth century poets; one who cannot be suspected of
any leaning toward Puritanism; one who had as high notions of his
vocation as any man; and one who so far fulfilled those notions
as to become a dramatist inferior only to Shakspeare.&nbsp; Let
Ben Jonson himself speak, and in his preface to
&lsquo;Volpone&rsquo; tell us in his own noble prose what he
thought of the average morality of his contemporary
playwrights:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;For if men will impartially and not asquint
look toward the offices and functions of a poet, they will easily
conclude to themselves the impossibility of any man&rsquo;s being
a good poet without first being a good man.&nbsp; He that is said
to be able to inform young men to all good discipline, inflame
grown men to all great virtues, keep old men in their best and
supreme state, or, as they decline to childhood, recover them to
their first strength; that comes forth the interpreter and
arbiter of nature, a teacher of things divine no less than human,
a master in manners and can alone (or with a few) effect the
business of mankind; this, I take him, is no subject for pride
and ignorance to exercise their railing rhetoric upon.&nbsp; But
it will here be hastily answered that the writers of these days
are other things, that not only their manners but their natures
are inverted, and nothing remaining of them of the dignity of
poet but the abused name, which every scribe usurps; that now,
especially in dramatick, or (as they term it) stage poetry,
nothing but ribaldry, profanation, blasphemies, all licence of
offence toward God and man is practised.&nbsp; I dare not deny a
great part of this (and I am sorry I dare not), because in some
men&rsquo;s abortive features (and would God they had never seen
the light!) it is over true; but that all are bound on his bold
adventure for hell, is a most uncharitable thought, and uttered,
a more malicious slander.&nbsp; For every particular I can (and
from a most clear conscience) affirm that I have ever trembled to
think toward the least profaneness, and have loathed the use of
such foul and unwashed . . . [his expression is too strong for
quotation] as is now made the food of the scene.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a pity to curtail this splendid passage, both for its
lofty ideal of poetry, and for its corroboration of the Puritan
complaints against the stage; but a few lines on a still stronger
sentence occurs:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The increase of which lust in liberty,
together with the present trade of the stage, in all their
masculine interludes, what liberal soul doth not abhor?&nbsp;
Where nothing but filth of the mire is uttered, and that with
such impropriety of phrase, such plenty of solecisms, such dearth
of sense, so bold prolepses, such racked metaphors, with
(indecency) able to violate the ear of a Pagan, and blasphemy to
turn the blood of a Christian to water.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So speaks Ben Jonson in 1605, not finding, it seems,
play-writing a peaceful trade, or play-poets and play-hearers
improving company.&nbsp; After him we should say no further
testimony on this unpleasant matter ought to be necessary.&nbsp;
He may have been morose, fanatical, exaggerative; but his bitter
words suggest at least this dilemma.&nbsp; Either they are true,
and the play-house atmosphere (as Prynne says it was) that of
Gehenna: or they are untrue, and the mere fruits of spite and
envy against more successful poets.&nbsp; And what does that
latter prove, but that the greatest poet of his age (after
Shakspeare has gone) was not as much esteemed as some poets whom
we know to have been more filthy and more horrible than he?
which, indeed, is the main complaint of Jonson himself.&nbsp; It
will be rejoined, of course, that he was an altogether envious
man; that he envied Shakspeare, girded at his York and Lancaster
plays, at &lsquo;The Winter&rsquo;s Tale&rsquo; and &lsquo;The
Tempest,&rsquo; in the prologue to &lsquo;Every Man in his
Humour&rsquo;; and, indeed, Jonson&rsquo;s writings, and those of
many other playwrights, leave little doubt that stage rivalry
called out the bitterest hatred and the basest vanity; and that,
perhaps, Shakspeare&rsquo;s great soul was giving way to the
pettiest passions, when in &lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; he had his fling
at the &lsquo;aiery of children, little eyases, that cry out on
the top of question, and are most tyrannically clapped for
&rsquo;t.&rsquo;&nbsp; It may be that he was girding in return at
Jonson, when he complained that &lsquo;their writer did them
wrong to make them complain against their own succession,&rsquo;
<i>i.e.</i> against themselves, when &lsquo;grown to common
players.&rsquo;&nbsp; Be that as it may.&nbsp; Great Shakspeare
may have been unjust to only less great Jonson, as Jonson was to
Shakspeare: but Jonson certainly is not so in all his
charges.&nbsp; Some of the faults which he attributes to
Shakspeare are really faults.</p>
<p>At all events, we know that he was not unjust to the average
of his contemporaries, by the evidence of the men&rsquo;s own
plays.&nbsp; We know that the decadence of the stage of which he
complains went on uninterruptedly after his time, and in the very
direction which he pointed out.</p>
<p>On this point there can be no doubt; for these hodmen of
poetry &lsquo;made a wall in our father&rsquo;s house, and the
bricks are alive to testify unto this day.&rsquo;&nbsp; So that
we cannot do better than give a few samples thereof, at least
samples decent enough for modern readers, and let us begin, not
with a hodman, but with Jonson himself.</p>
<p>Now, Ben Jonson is worthy of our love and respect, for he was
a very great genius, immaculate or not; &lsquo;Rare Ben,&rsquo;
with all his faults.&nbsp; One can never look without affection
on the magnificent manhood of that rich free forehead, even
though one may sigh over the petulance and pride which brood upon
the lip and eyebrow,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Dowered with the hate of hate, the scorn of
scorn,<br />
The love of love.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Michael Angelo who could laugh, which that Italian one, one
fancies, never could.&nbsp; One ought to have, too, a sort of
delicacy about saying much against him; for he is dead, and can
make, for the time being at least, no rejoinder.&nbsp; There are
dead men whom one is not much ashamed to &lsquo;upset&rsquo;
after their death, because one would not have been much afraid of
doing so when they were alive.&nbsp; But &lsquo;Rare Ben&rsquo;
had terrible teeth, and used them too.&nbsp; A man would have
thought twice ere he snapt at him living, and therefore it seems
somewhat a cowardly trick to bark securely at his ghost.&nbsp;
Nevertheless it is no unfair question to ask&mdash;Do not his own
words justify the Puritan complaints?&nbsp; But if so, why does
he rail at the Puritans for making their complaints?&nbsp; His
answer would have been that they railed in ignorance, not merely
at low art, as we call it now, but at high art and all art.&nbsp;
Be it so.&nbsp; Here was their fault, if fault it was in those
days.&nbsp; For to discriminate between high art and low art they
must have seen both.&nbsp; And for Jonson&rsquo;s wrath to be
fair and just he must have shown them both.&nbsp; Let us see what
the pure drama is like which he wishes to substitute for the foul
drama of his contemporaries; and, to bring the matter nearer
home, let us take one of the plays in which he hits deliberately
at the Puritans, namely the &lsquo;Alchemist,&rsquo; said to have
been first acted in 1610 &lsquo;by the king&rsquo;s
majesty&rsquo;s servants.&rsquo;&nbsp; Look, then, at this
well-known play, and take Jonson at his word.&nbsp; Allow that
Ananias and Tribulation Wholesome are, as they very probably are,
fair portraits of a class among the sectaries of the day: but
bear in mind, too, that if this be allowed, the other characters
shall be held as fair portraits also.&nbsp; Otherwise, all must
he held to be caricature; and then the onslaught on the Puritans
vanishes into nothing, or worse.&nbsp; Now in either case,
Ananias and Tribulation are the best men in the play.&nbsp; They
palter with their consciences, no doubt: but they have
consciences, which no one else in the play has, except poor
Surly; and he, be it remembered, comes to shame, is made a
laughing-stock, and &lsquo;cheats himself,&rsquo; as he complains
at last, &lsquo;by that same foolish vice of honesty&rsquo;:
while in all the rest what have we but every form of human
baseness?&nbsp; Lovell, the master, if he is to be considered a
negative character as doing no wrong, has, at all events, no more
recorded of him than the noble act of marrying by deceit a young
widow for the sake of her money, the philosopher&rsquo;s stone,
by the bye, and highest object of most of the seventeenth century
dramatists.&nbsp; If most of the rascals meet with due disgrace,
none of them is punished; and the greatest rascal of all, who,
when escape is impossible, turns traitor, and after deserving the
cart and pillory a dozen times for his last and most utter
baseness, is rewarded by full pardon, and the honour of
addressing the audience at the play&rsquo;s end in the most smug
and self-satisfied tone, and of &lsquo;putting himself on you
that are my country,&rsquo; not doubting, it seems, that there
were among them a fair majority who would think him a very smart
fellow, worthy of all imitation.</p>
<p>Now is this play a moral or an immoral one?&nbsp; Of its
coarseness we say nothing.&nbsp; We should not endure it, of
course, nowadays; and on that point something must be said
hereafter: but if we were to endure plain speaking as the only
method of properly exposing vice, should we endure the moral
which, instead of punishing vice, rewards it?</p>
<p>And, meanwhile, what sort of a general state of society among
the Anti-Puritan party does the play sketch?&nbsp; What but a
background of profligacy and frivolity?</p>
<p>A proof, indeed, of the general downward tendencies of the age
may be found in the writings of Ben Jonson himself.&nbsp;
Howsoever pure and lofty the ideal which he laid down for himself
(and no doubt honestly) in the Preface to &lsquo;Volpone,&rsquo;
he found it impossible to keep up to it.&nbsp; Nine years
afterwards we find him, in his &lsquo;Bartholomew Fair,&rsquo;
catering to the low tastes of James the First in ribaldry at
which, if one must needs laugh&mdash;as who that was not more
than man could help doing over that scene between Rabbi Busy and
the puppets?&mdash;shallow and untrue as the gist of the humour
is, one feels the next moment as if one had been indulging in
unholy mirth at the expense of some grand old Noah who has come
to shame in his cups.</p>
<p>But lower still does Jonson fall in that Masque of the
&lsquo;Gipsies Metamorphosed,&rsquo; presented to the king in
1621, when Jonson was forty-seven; old enough, one would have
thought, to know better.&nbsp; It is not merely the insincere and
all but blasphemous adulation which is shocking,&mdash;that was
but the fashion of the times: but the treating these gipsies and
beggars, and their &lsquo;thieves&rsquo; Latin&rsquo; dialect,
their filthiness and cunning, ignorance and recklessness, merely
as themes for immoral and inhuman laughter.&nbsp; Jonson was by
no means the only poet of that day to whom the hordes of
profligate and heathen nomads which infested England were only a
comical phase of humanity, instead of being, as they would be
now, objects of national shame and sorrow, of pity and love,
which would call out in the attempt to redeem them the talents
and energies of good men.&nbsp; But Jonson certainly sins more in
this respect than any of his contemporaries.&nbsp; He takes a low
pleasure in parading his intimate acquaintance with these poor
creatures&rsquo; foul slang and barbaric laws; and is, we should
say, the natural father of that lowest form of all literature,
which has since amused the herd, though in a form greatly
purified, in the form of &lsquo;Beggars&rsquo; Operas,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Dick Turpins,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Jack
Sheppards.&rsquo;&nbsp; Everything which is objectionable in such
modern publications as these was exhibited, in far grosser forms,
by one of the greatest poets who ever lived, for the amusement of
a king of England; and yet the world still is at a loss to know
why sober and God-fearing men detested both the poet and the
king.</p>
<p>And that Masque is all the more saddening exhibition of the
degradation of a great soul, because in it, here and there, occur
passages of the old sweetness and grandeur; <i>disjecta membra
poet&aelig;</i> such as these, which, even although addressed to
James, are perfect:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;3<i>rd</i>
<i>Gipsy</i>.</p>
<p>Look how the winds upon the waves grow tame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Take up land sounds upon their purple wings,<br />
And, catching each from other, bear the same<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To every angle of their sacred springs.<br />
So will we take his praise, and hurl his name<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; About the globe, in thousand airy rings.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * *</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us pass on.&nbsp; Why stay to look upon the fall of such a
spirit?</p>
<p>There is one point, nevertheless, which we may as well speak
of here, and shortly; for spoken of it must be as delicately as
is possible.&nbsp; The laugh raised at Zeal-for-the-land
Busy&rsquo;s expense, in &lsquo;Bartholomew Fair,&rsquo; turns on
the Puritan dislike of seeing women&rsquo;s parts acted by
boys.&nbsp; Jonson shirks the question by making poor Busy fall
foul of puppets instead of live human beings: but the question is
shirked nevertheless.&nbsp; What honest answer he could have
given to the Puritans is hard to conceive.&nbsp; Prynne, in his
&lsquo;Histriomastix,&rsquo; may have pushed a little too far the
argument drawn from the prohibition in the Mosaic law: yet one
would fancy that the practice was forbidden by Moses&rsquo; law,
not arbitrarily, but because it was a bad practice, which did
harm, as every antiquarian knows that it did; and that,
therefore, Prynne was but reasonable in supposing that in his day
a similar practice would produce a similar evil.&nbsp; Our firm
conviction is that it did so, and that as to the matter of fact,
Prynne was perfectly right; and that to make a boy a stage-player
was pretty certainly to send him to the devil.&nbsp; Let any man
of common sense imagine to himself the effect on a young
boy&rsquo;s mind which would be produced by representing
shamelessly before a public audience not merely the language, but
the passions, of such women as occur in almost every play.&nbsp;
We appeal to common sense&mdash;would any father allow his own
children to personate, even in private, the basest of
mankind?&nbsp; And yet we must beg pardon: for common sense, it
is to be supposed, has decided against us, as long as parents
allow their sons to act yearly at Westminster the stupid low art
of Terence, while grave and reverend prelates and divines look on
approving.&nbsp; The Westminster play has had no very purifying
influence on the minds of the young gentlemen who personate
heathen damsels; and we only ask, What must have been the effect
of representing far fouler characters than Terence&rsquo;s on the
minds of uneducated lads of the lower classes?&nbsp; Prynne and
others hint at still darker abominations than the mere defilement
of the conscience: we shall say nothing of them, but that, from
collateral evidence, we believe every word they say; and that
when pretty little Cupid&rsquo;s mother, in Jonson&rsquo;s
Christmas masque, tells how &lsquo;She could have had money
enough for him, had she been tempted, and have let him out by the
week to the king&rsquo;s players,&rsquo; and how &lsquo;Master
Burbadge has been about and about with her for him, and old Mr.
Hemings too,&rsquo; she had better have tied a stone round the
child&rsquo;s neck, and hove him over London Bridge, than have
handed him over to thrifty Burbadge, that he might make out of
his degradation more money to buy land withal, and settle
comfortably in his native town, on the fruits of others&rsquo;
sin.&nbsp; Honour to old Prynne, bitter and narrow as he was, for
his passionate and eloquent appeals to the humanity and
Christianity of England, in behalf of those poor children whom
not a bishop on the bench interfered to save; but, while they
were writing and persecuting in behalf of baptismal regeneration,
left those to perish whom they declared so stoutly to be
regenerate in baptism.&nbsp; Prynne used that argument too, and
declared these stage-plays to be among the very &lsquo;pomps and
vanities which Christians renounced at baptism.&rsquo;&nbsp; He
may or may not have been wrong in identifying them with the old
heathen pantomimes and games of the circus, and in burying his
adversaries under a mountain of quotations from the Fathers and
the Romish divines (for Prynne&rsquo;s reading seems to have been
quite enormous).&nbsp; Those very prelates could express
reverence enough for the Fathers when they found aught in them
which could be made to justify their own system, though perhaps
it had really even less to do therewith than the Roman pantomimes
had with the Globe Theatre: but the Church of England had
retained in her Catechism the old Roman word &lsquo;pomps,&rsquo;
as one of the things which were to be renounced; and as
&lsquo;pomps&rsquo; confessedly meant at first those very
spectacles of the heathen circus and theatre, Prynne could not be
very illogical in believing that, as it had been retained, it was
retained to testify against something, and probably against the
thing in England most like the &lsquo;pomps&rsquo; of heathen
Rome.&nbsp; Meanwhile, let Churchmen decide whether of the two
was the better Churchman&mdash;Prynne, who tried to make the
baptismal covenant mean something, or Laud, who allowed such a
play as &lsquo;The Ordinary&rsquo; to be written by his especial
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>, Cartwright, the Oxford scholar, and
acted before him probably by Oxford scholars, certainly by
christened boys.&nbsp; We do not pretend to pry into the counsels
of the Most High; but if unfaithfulness to a high and holy trust,
when combined with lofty professions and pretensions, does (as
all history tells us that it does) draw down the vengeance of
Almighty God, then we need look no further than this one neglect
of the seventeenth century prelates (whether its cause was
stupidity, insincerity, or fear of the monarchs to whose tyranny
they pandered), to discover full reason why it pleased God to
sweep them out awhile with the besom of destruction.</p>
<p>There is another feature in the plays of the seventeenth
century, new, as far as we know, alike to English literature and
manners; and that is, the apotheosis of Rakes.&nbsp; Let the
faults of the Middle Age, or of the Tudors, have been what they
may, that class of person was in their time simply an object of
disgust.&nbsp; The word which then signified a Rake is, in the
&lsquo;Morte d&rsquo;Arthur&rsquo; (temp. Ed. IV.), the foulest
term of disgrace which can be cast upon a knight; whilst even up
to the latter years of Elizabeth the contempt of parents and
elders seems to have been thought a grievous sin.&nbsp; In Italy,
even, fountain of all the abominations of the age, respect for
the fifth commandment seems to have lingered after all the other
nine had been forgotten; we find Castiglione, in his
&lsquo;Corteggiano&rsquo; (about 1520), regretting the modest and
respectful training of the generation which had preceded him; and
to judge from facts, the Puritan method of education, stern as it
was, was neither more nor less than the method which, a
generation before, had been common to Romanist and to Protestant,
Puritan and Churchman.</p>
<p>But with the Stuart era (perhaps at the end of
Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign) fathers became gradually personages who
are to be disobeyed, sucked of their money, fooled, even now and
then robbed and beaten, by the young gentlemen of spirit; and the
most Christian kings, James and Charles, with their queens and
court, sit by to see ruffling and roystering, beating the watch
and breaking windows, dicing, drinking, duelling, and profligacy
(provided the victim be not a woman of gentle birth), set forth
not merely as harmless amusements for young gentlemen, but (as in
Beaumont and Fletcher&rsquo;s play of &lsquo;Monsieur
Thomas&rsquo;) virtues without which a man is despicable.&nbsp;
On this point, as on many others, those who have, for
ecclesiastical reasons, tried to represent the first half of the
seventeenth century as a golden age have been altogether
unfair.&nbsp; There is no immorality of the court plays of
Charles II.&rsquo;s time which may not be found in those of
Charles I.&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Sedley and Etherege are not a whit
worse, but only more stupid, than Fletcher or Shirley; and
Monsieur Thomas is the spiritual father of all Angry lads,
Rufflers, Blades, Bullies, Mohocks, Corinthians, and Dandies,
down to the last drunken clerk who wrenched off a knocker, or
robbed his master&rsquo;s till to pay his losses at a
betting-office.&nbsp; True; we of this generation can hardly
afford to throw stones.&nbsp; The scapegrace ideal of humanity
has enjoyed high patronage within the last half century; and if
Monsieur Thomas seemed lovely in the eyes of James and Charles,
so did Jerry and Corinthian Tom in those of some of the first
gentlemen of England.&nbsp; Better days, however, have dawned;
&lsquo;Tom and Jerry,&rsquo; instead of running three hundred
nights, would be as little endured on the stage as
&lsquo;Monsieur Thomas&rsquo; would be; the heroes who aspire
toward that ideal are now consigned by public opinion to
Rhadamanthus and the treadmill; while if, like Monsieur Thomas,
they knocked down their own father, they would, instead of
winning a good wife, be &lsquo;cut&rsquo; by braver and finer
gentlemen than Monsieur Thomas himself: but what does this fact
prove save that England has at last discovered that the Puritan
opinion of this matter (as of some others) was the right one?</p>
<p>There is another aspect in which we must look at the Stuart
patronage of profligate scapegraces on the stage.&nbsp; They
would not have been endured on the stage had they not been very
common off it; and if there had not been, too, in the hearts of
spectators some lurking excuse for them: it requires no great
penetration to see what that excuse must have been.&nbsp; If the
Stuart age, aristocracy, and court were as perfect as some fancy
them, such fellows would have been monstrous in it and
inexcusable, probably impossible.&nbsp; But if it was (as it may
be proved to have been) an utterly deboshed, insincere, decrepit,
and decaying age, then one cannot but look on Monsieur Thomas
with something of sympathy as well as pity.&nbsp; Take him as he
stands; he is a fellow of infinite kindliness, wit, spirit, and
courage, but with nothing on which to employ those powers.&nbsp;
He would have done his work admirably in an earnest and
enterprising age as a Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company clerk, an Indian
civilian, a captain of a man-of-war&mdash;anything where he could
find a purpose and a work.&nbsp; Doubt it not.&nbsp; How many a
Monsieur Thomas of our own days, whom a few years ago one had
rashly fancied capable of nothing higher than coulisses and
cigars, private theatricals and white kid gloves, has been not
only fighting and working like a man, but meditating and writing
homeward like a Christian, through the dull misery of those
trenches at Sevastopol; and has found, amid the Crimean snows,
that merciful fire of God, which could burn the chaff out of his
heart and thaw the crust of cold frivolity into warm and earnest
life.&nbsp; And even at such a youth&rsquo;s worst, reason and
conscience alike forbid us to deal out to him the same measure as
we do to the offences of the cool and hoary profligate, or to the
darker and subtler spiritual sins of the false professor.&nbsp;
But if the wrath of God be not unmistakably and practically
revealed from heaven against youthful profligacy and disobedience
in after sorrow and shame of some kind or other, against what sin
is it revealed?&nbsp; It was not left for our age to discover
that the wages of sin is death: but Charles, his players and his
courtiers, refused to see what the very heathen had seen, and so
had to be taught the truth over again by another and a more
literal lesson; and what neither stage-plays nor sermons could
teach them, sharp shot and cold steel did.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But still the Puritans were barbarians for hating Art
altogether.&rsquo;&nbsp; The fact was, that they hated what art
they saw in England, and that this was low art, bad art, growing
ever lower and worse.&nbsp; If it be said that Shakspeare&rsquo;s
is the very highest art, the answer is, that what they hated in
him was not his high art, but his low art, the foul and horrible
elements which he had in common with his brother
play-writers.&nbsp; True, there is far less of these elements in
Shakspeare than in any of his compeers: but they are there.&nbsp;
And what the Puritans hated in him was exactly what we have to
expunge before we can now represent his plays.&nbsp; If it be
said that they ought to have discerned and appreciated the higher
elements in him, so ought the rest of their generation.&nbsp; The
Puritans were surely not bound to see in Shakspeare what his
patrons and brother poets did not see.&nbsp; And it is surely a
matter of fact that the deep spiritual knowledge which makes, and
will make, Shakspeare&rsquo;s plays (and them alone of all the
seventeenth century plays) a heritage for all men and all ages,
quite escaped the insight of his contemporaries, who probably put
him in the same rank which Webster, writing about 1612, has
assigned to him.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I have ever cherished a good opinion of
other men&rsquo;s witty labours, especially of that full and
heightened style of Master Chapman; the laboured and
understanding works of Mr. Jonson; the no less witty composures
of the both wittily excellent Mr. Beaumont and Mr. Fletcher; and
lastly (without wrong last to be named), the right happy and
copious industry of Shakspeare, Mr. Dekker, and Mr.
Heywood.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Webster, then, one of the best poets of the time, sees
nothing in Shakspeare beyond the same &lsquo;happy and copious
industry&rsquo; which he sees in Dekker and Heywood,&mdash;while
Cartwright, perhaps the only young poet of real genius in Charles
the First&rsquo;s reign, places Fletcher&rsquo;s name
&lsquo;&rsquo;Twixt Jonson&rsquo;s grave and Shakspeare&rsquo;s
lighter sound,&rsquo; and tells him that</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Shakspeare to thee was dull, whose best wit
lies<br />
I&rsquo; th&rsquo; ladies&rsquo; questions, and the fool&rsquo;s
replies.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Whose wit our nice times would obsceneness call.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Nature was all his art; thy vein was free<br />
As his, but without his scurrility;&rsquo; <a
name="citation46"></a><a href="#footnote46"
class="citation">[46]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>while even Milton, who, Puritan as he was, loved art with all
his soul, only remarks on Shakspeare&rsquo;s marvellous lyrical
sweetness, &lsquo;his native wood-notes wild&rsquo;; what shame
to the Puritans if they, too, did not discover the stork among
the cranes?</p>
<p>An answer has often been given to arguments of this kind,
which deserves a few moments&rsquo; consideration.&nbsp; It is
said, &lsquo;the grossness of the old play-writers was their
misfortune, not their crime.&nbsp; It was the fashion of the
age.&nbsp; It is not our fashion, certainly; but they meant no
harm by it.&nbsp; The age was a free-spoken one; and perhaps none
the worse for that.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Dyce, indeed, the editor of
Webster&rsquo;s plays, seems inclined to exalt this habit into a
virtue.&nbsp; After saying that the licentious and debauched are
made &lsquo;as odious in representation as they would be if they
were actually present&rsquo;&mdash;an assertion which must be
flatly denied, save in the case of Shakspeare, who seldom or
never, to our remembrance, seems to forget that the wages of sin
is death, and who, however coarse he may be, keeps stoutly on the
side of virtue&mdash;Mr. Dyce goes on to say, that &lsquo;perhaps
the language of the stage is purified in proportion as our morals
are deteriorated; and we dread the mention of the vices which we
are not ashamed to practise; while our forefathers, under the
sway of a less fastidious but a more energetic principle of
virtue, were careless of words, and only considerate of
actions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To this clever piece of special pleading we can only answer
that the fact is directly contrary; that there is a mass of
unanimous evidence which cannot be controverted to prove that
England, in the first half of the seventeenth century was far
more immoral than in the nineteenth; that the proofs lie patent
to any dispassionate reader: but that these pages will not be
defiled by the details of them.</p>
<p>Let it be said that coarseness was &lsquo;the fashion of the
age.&rsquo;&nbsp; The simple question is, was it a good fashion
or a bad?&nbsp; It is said&mdash;with little or no
proof&mdash;that in simple states of society much manly virtue
and much female purity have often consisted with very broad
language and very coarse manners.&nbsp; But what of that?&nbsp;
Drunkards may very often be very honest and brave men.&nbsp; Does
that make drunkenness no sin?&nbsp; Or will honesty and courage
prevent a man&rsquo;s being the worse for hard drinking?&nbsp; If
so, why have we given up coarseness of language?&nbsp; And why
has it been the better rather than the worse part of the nation,
the educated and religious rather than the ignorant and wicked,
who have given it up?&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Simply because this
nation, and all other nations on the Continent, in proportion to
their morality, have found out that coarseness of language is, to
say the least, unfit and inexpedient; that if it be wrong to do
certain things, it is also, on the whole, right not to talk of
them; that even certain things which are right and blessed and
holy lose their sanctity by being dragged cynically to the light
of day, instead of being left in the mystery in which God has
wisely shrouded them.&nbsp; On the whole, one is inclined to
suspect the defence of coarseness as insincere.&nbsp; Certainly,
in our day, it will not hold.&nbsp; If any one wishes to hear
coarse language in &lsquo;good society&rsquo; he can hear it, I
am told, in Paris: but one questions whether Parisian society be
now &lsquo;under the sway of a more energetic principle of
virtue&rsquo; than our own.&nbsp; The sum total of the matter
seems to be, that England has found out that on this point again
the old Puritans were right.&nbsp; And quaintly enough, the party
in the English Church who hold the Puritans most in abhorrence
are the most scrupulous now upon this very point; and, in their
dread of contaminating the minds of youth, are carrying
education, at school and college, to such a more than Puritan
precision that with the most virtuous and benevolent intentions
they are in danger of giving lads merely a conventional
education,&mdash;a hot-house training which will render them
incapable hereafter of facing either the temptations or the
labour of the world.&nbsp; They themselves republished
Massinger&rsquo;s &lsquo;Virgin Martyr,&rsquo; because it was a
pretty Popish story, probably written by a Papist&mdash;for there
is every reason to believe that Massinger was one&mdash;setting
forth how the heroine was attended all through by an angel in the
form of a page, and how&mdash;not to mention the really beautiful
ancient fiction about the fruits which Dorothea sends back from
Paradise&mdash;Theophilus overcomes the devil by means of a cross
composed of flowers.&nbsp; Massinger&rsquo;s account of
Theophilus&rsquo; conversation will, we fear, make those who know
anything of that great crisis of the human spirit suspect that
Massinger&rsquo;s experience thereof was but small: but the fact
which is most noteworthy is this&mdash;that the &lsquo;Virgin
Martyr&rsquo; is actually one of the foulest plays known.&nbsp;
Every pains has been taken to prove that the indecent scenes in
the play were not written by Massinger, but by Dekker; on what
grounds we know not.&nbsp; If Dekker assisted Massinger in the
play, as he is said to have done, we are aware of no canons of
internal criticism which will enable us to decide, as boldly as
Mr. Gifford does, that all the indecency is Dekker&rsquo;s, and
all the poetry Massinger&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He confesses&mdash;as
indeed he is forced to do&mdash;that &lsquo;Massinger himself is
not free from dialogues of low wit and buffoonery&rsquo;; and
then, after calling the scenes in question &lsquo;detestable
ribaldry, &lsquo;a loathsome sooterkin, engendered of filth and
dulness,&rsquo; recommends them to the reader&rsquo;s supreme
scorn and contempt,&mdash;with which feelings the reader will
doubtless regard them: but he will also, if he be a thinking man,
draw from them the following conclusions: that even if they be
Dekker&rsquo;s&mdash;of which there is no proof&mdash;Massinger
was forced, in order to the success of his play, to pander to the
public taste by allowing Dekker to interpolate these villanies;
that the play which, above all others of the seventeenth century,
contains the most supralunar rosepink of piety, devotion, and
purity, also contains the stupidest abominations of any extant
play; and lastly, that those who reprinted it as a sample of the
Christianity of that past golden age of High-churchmanship, had
to leave out one-third of the play, for fear of becoming amenable
to the laws against abominable publications.</p>
<p>No one denies that there are nobler words than any that we
have quoted, in Jonson, in Fletcher, or in Massinger; but there
is hardly a play (perhaps none) of theirs in which the
immoralities of which we complain do not exist,&mdash;few of
which they do not form an integral part; and now, if this is the
judgment which we have to pass on the morality of the greater
poets, what must the lesser ones be like?</p>
<p>Look, then, at Webster&rsquo;s two masterpieces,
&lsquo;Vittoria Corrombona&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Duchess of
Malfi.&rsquo;&nbsp; A few words spent on them will surely not be
wasted; for they are pretty generally agreed to be the two best
tragedies written since Shakspeare&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>The whole story of &lsquo;Vittoria Corrombona&rsquo; is one of
sin and horror.&nbsp; The subject-matter of the play is
altogether made up of the fiercest and the basest passions.&nbsp;
But the play is not a study of those passions from which we may
gain a great insight into human nature.&nbsp; There is no
trace&mdash;nor is there, again, in the &lsquo;Duchess of
Malfi&rsquo;&mdash;of that development of human souls for good or
evil which is Shakspeare&rsquo;s especial power&mdash;the power
which, far more than any accidental &lsquo;beauties,&rsquo; makes
his plays, to this day, the delight alike of the simple and the
wise, while his contemporaries are all but forgotten.&nbsp; The
highest aim of dramatic art is to exhibit the development of the
human soul; to construct dramas in which the conclusion shall
depend, not on the events, but on the characters; and in which
the characters shall not be mere embodiments of a certain
passion, or a certain &lsquo;humour&rsquo;: but persons, each
unlike all others; each having a destiny of his own by virtue of
his own peculiarities, and of his own will; and each proceeding
toward that destiny as he shall conquer, or yield to,
circumstances; unfolding his own strength and weakness before the
eyes of the audience; and that in such a way that, after his
first introduction, they should be able (in proportion to their
knowledge of human nature) to predict his conduct under those
circumstances.&nbsp; This is indeed &lsquo;high art&rsquo;: but
we find no more of it in Webster than in the rest.&nbsp; His
characters, be they old or young, come on the stage ready-made,
full grown, and stereotyped; and therefore, in general, they are
not characters at all, but mere passions or humours in human
form.&nbsp; Now and then he essays to draw a character: but it is
analytically, by description, not synthetically and dramatically,
by letting the man exhibit himself in action; and in the
&lsquo;Duchess of Mall&rsquo; he falls into the great mistake of
telling, by Antonio&rsquo;s mouth, more about the Duke and the
Cardinal than he afterwards makes them act.&nbsp; Very different
is Shakspeare&rsquo;s method of giving, at the outset, some
single delicate hint about his personages which will serve as a
clue to their whole future conduct; thus &lsquo;showing the whole
in each part,&rsquo; and stamping each man with a personality, to
a degree which no other dramatist has ever approached.</p>
<p>But the truth is, the study of human nature is not
Webster&rsquo;s aim.&nbsp; He has to arouse terror and pity, not
thought, and he does it in his own way, by blood and fury, madmen
and screech-owls, not without a rugged power.&nbsp; There are
scenes of his, certainly, like that of Vittoria&rsquo;s trial,
which have been praised for their delineation of character: but
it is one thing to solve the problem, which Shakspeare has so
handled in &lsquo;Lear,&rsquo; &lsquo;Othello,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Richard the Third,&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Given a mixed
character, to show how he may become criminal,&rsquo; and to
solve Webster&rsquo;s &lsquo;Given a ready-made criminal, to show
how he commits his crimes.&rsquo;&nbsp; To us the knowledge of
character shown in Vittoria&rsquo;s trial scene is not an insight
into Vittoria&rsquo;s essential heart and brain, but a general
acquaintance with the conduct of all bold bad women when brought
to bay.&nbsp; Poor Elia, who knew the world from books, and human
nature principally from his own loving and gentle heart, talks of
Vittoria&rsquo;s &lsquo;innocence&mdash;resembling
boldness&rsquo; <a name="citation53"></a><a href="#footnote53"
class="citation">[53]</a>&mdash;and &lsquo;seeming to see that
matchless beauty of her face, which inspires such gay confidence
in her,&rsquo; and so forth.</p>
<p>Perfectly just and true, not of Vittoria merely, but of the
average of bad young women in the presence of a police
magistrate: yet amounting in all merely to this, that the
strength of Webster&rsquo;s confest master-scene lies simply in
intimate acquaintance with vicious nature in general.&nbsp; We
will say no more on this matter, save to ask, <i>Cui
bono</i>?&nbsp; Was the art of which this was the highest
manifestation likely to be of much use to mankind, much less able
to excuse its palpably disgusting and injurious
accompaniments?</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Duchess of Malfi&rsquo; is certainly in a purer and
loftier strain: but in spite of the praise which has been
lavished on her, we must take the liberty to doubt whether the
poor Duchess is a &lsquo;person&rsquo; at all.&nbsp; General
goodness and beauty, intense though pure affection for a man
below her in rank, and a will to carry out her purpose at all
hazards, are not enough to distinguish her from thousands of
other women: but Webster has no such purpose.&nbsp; What he was
thinking and writing of was not truth, but effect; not the
Duchess, but her story; not her brothers, but their rage; not
Antonio, her major-domo and husband, but his good and bad
fortunes; and thus he has made Antonio merely insipid, the
brothers merely unnatural, and the Duchess (in the critical
moment of the play) merely forward.&nbsp; That curious scene, in
which she acquaints Antonio with her love for him and makes him
marry her, is, on the whole, painful.&nbsp; Webster himself seems
to have felt that it was so; and, dreading lest he had gone too
far, to have tried to redeem the Duchess at the end by making her
break down in two exquisite lines of loving shame: but he has
utterly forgotten to explain or justify her love by giving to
Antonio (as Shakspeare would probably have done) such strong
specialties of character as would compel, and therefore excuse,
his mistress&rsquo;s affection.&nbsp; He has plenty of time to do
this in the first scenes,&mdash;time which he wastes on
irrelevant matter; and all that we gather from them is that
Antonio is a worthy and thoughtful person.&nbsp; If he gives
promise of being more, he utterly disappoints that promise
afterwards.&nbsp; In the scene in which the Duchess tells her
love, he is far smaller, rather than greater, than the Antonio of
the opening scene: though (as there) altogether passive.&nbsp; He
hears his mistress&rsquo;s declaration just as any other
respectable youth might; is exceedingly astonished, and a good
deal frightened; has to be talked out of his fears till one
naturally expects a revulsion on the Duchess&rsquo;s part into
something like scorn or shame (which might have given a good
opportunity for calling out sudden strength in Antonio): but so
busy is Webster with his business of drawing mere blind love,
that he leaves Antonio to be a mere puppet, whose worthiness we
are to believe in only from the Duchess&rsquo;s assurance to him
that he is the perfection of all that a man should be; which, as
all lovers are of the same opinion the day before the wedding, is
not of much importance.</p>
<p>Neither in his subsequent misfortunes does Antonio make the
least struggle to prove himself worthy of his mistress&rsquo;s
affection.&nbsp; He is very resigned and loving, and so
forth.&nbsp; To win renown by great deeds, and so prove his wife
in the right to her brothers and all the world, never crosses his
imagination.&nbsp; His highest aim (and that only at last) is
slavishly to entreat pardon from his brothers-in-law for the mere
offence of marrying their sister; and he dies by an improbable
accident, the same pious and respectable insipidity which he has
lived,&mdash;&lsquo;<i>ne valant pas la peine qui se donne pour
lui</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; The prison-scenes between the Duchess and
her tormentors are painful enough, if to give pain be a dramatic
virtue; and she appears in them really noble; and might have
appeared far more so, had Webster taken half as much pains with
her as he has with the madmen, ruffians, ghosts, and screech-owls
in which his heart really delights.&nbsp; The only character
really worked out so as to live and grow under his hand is
Bosola, who, of course, is the villain of the piece, and being a
rough fabric, is easily manufactured with rough tools.&nbsp;
Still, Webster has his wonderful touches here and
there&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<i>Cariola</i>.&nbsp; Hence, villains,
tyrants, murderers!&nbsp; Alas<br />
What will you do with my lady?&nbsp; Call for help!<br />
<i>Duchess</i>.&nbsp; To whom? to our next neighbours? they are
mad folk.<br />
Farewell, Cariola.<br />
I pray thee look thou giv&rsquo;st my little boy<br />
Some syrup for his cold; and let the girl<br />
Say her prayers ere she sleep.&mdash;Now, what you please;<br />
What death?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so the play ends, as does &lsquo;Vittoria
Corrombona,&rsquo; with half a dozen murders <i>coram populo</i>,
howls, despair, bedlam, and the shambles; putting the reader
marvellously in mind of that well-known old book of the same era,
&lsquo;Reynolds&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s Revenge,&rsquo; in which,
with all due pious horror and bombastic sermonising, the national
appetite for abominations is duly fed with some fifty unreadable
Spanish histories, French histories, Italian histories, and so
forth, one or two of which, of course, are known to have
furnished subjects for the playwrights of the day.</p>
<p>The next play-writer whom we are bound to notice is James
Shirley, one of the many converts to Romanism which those days
saw.&nbsp; He appears, up to the breaking out of the Civil War,
to have been the Queen&rsquo;s favourite poet; and, according to
Laugbaine, he was &lsquo;one of such incomparable parts that he
was the chief of the second-rate poets, and by some has been
thought even equal to Fletcher himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We must entreat the reader&rsquo;s attention while we examine
Shirley&rsquo;s &lsquo;Gamester.&rsquo;&nbsp; Whether the
examination be a pleasant business or not, it is somewhat
important; &lsquo;for,&rsquo; says Mr. Dyce, &lsquo;the following
memorandum respecting it occurs in the office-book of the Master
of the Records:&mdash;&ldquo;On Thursday night, 6th of February,
1633, &lsquo;The Gamester&rsquo; was acted at Court, made by
Sherley out of a plot of the king&rsquo;s, given him by mee, and
well likte.&nbsp; The king sayd it was the best play he had seen
for seven years.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>This is indeed important.&nbsp; We shall now have an
opportunity of fairly testing at the same time the taste of the
Royal Martyr and the average merit, at least in the opinion of
the Caroline court, of the dramatists of that day.</p>
<p>The plot which Charles sent to Shirley as a fit subject for
his muse is taken from one of those collections of Italian novels
of which we have already had occasion to speak, and occurs in the
second part of the &lsquo;Ducento Novelle&rsquo; of Celio
Malespini; and what it is we shall see forthwith.</p>
<p>The play opens with a scene between one Wilding and his ward
Penelope, in which he attempts to seduce the young lady, in
language which has certainly the merit of honesty.&nbsp; She
refuses him, but civilly enough; and on her departure Mrs.
Wilding enters, who, it seems, is the object of her
husband&rsquo;s loathing, though young, handsome, and in all
respects charming enough.&nbsp; After a scene of stupid and
brutal insults, he actually asks her to bring Penelope to him, at
which she naturally goes out in anger; and Hazard, the gamester,
enters,&mdash;a personage without a character, in any sense of
the word.&nbsp; There is next some talk against duelling,
sensible enough, which arises out of a bye-plot,&mdash;one
Delamere having been wounded in a duel by one Beaumont, mortally
as is supposed.&nbsp; This bye-plot runs through the play, giving
an opportunity for bringing in a father of the usual play-house
type,&mdash;a Sir Richard Hurry, who is, of course, as stupid,
covetous, proud, and tyrannical and unfeeling, as play-house
fathers were then bound to be: but it is a plot of the most
commonplace form, turning on the stale trick of a man expecting
to be hanged for killing some one who turns out after all to have
recovered, and having no bearing whatsoever on the real plot,
which is this,&mdash;Mrs. Wilding, in order to win back her
husband&rsquo;s affections, persuades Penelope to seem to grant
his suit; while Mrs. Wilding herself is in reality to supply her
niece&rsquo;s place, and shame her husband into virtue.&nbsp;
Wilding tells Hazard of the good fortune which he fancies is
coming, in scenes of which one can only say, that if they are not
written for the purpose of exciting the passions, it is hard to
see why they were written at all.&nbsp; But, being with Hazard in
a gambling-house at the very hour at which he is to meet
Penelope, and having had a run of bad luck, he borrows a hundred
pounds of Hazard, stays at the table to recover his losses, and
sends Hazard to supply his place with the supposed
Penelope.&nbsp; A few hours before Penelope and Hazard have met
for the first time, and Penelope considers him, as she says to
herself aside, &lsquo;a handsome gentleman.&rsquo;&nbsp; He
begins, of course, talking foully to her; and the lady, so far
from being shocked at the freedom of her new acquaintance, pays
him back in his own coin in such good earnest that she soon
silences him in the battle of dirt-throwing.&nbsp; Of this sad
scene it is difficult to say whether it indicates a lower
standard of purity and courtesy in the poet, in the audience who
endured it, or in the society of which it was, of course,
intended to be a brilliant picture.&nbsp; If the cavaliers and
damsels of Charles the First&rsquo;s day were in the habit of
talking in that way to each other (and if they had not been,
Shirley would not have dared to represent them as doing so), one
cannot much wonder that the fire of God was needed to burn up
(though, alas! only for a while) such a state of society; and
that when needed the fire fell.</p>
<p>The rest of the story is equally bad.&nbsp; Hazard next day
gives Wilding descriptions of his guilt, and while Wilding is in
the height of self-reproach at having handed over his victim to
another, his wife meets him and informs him that she herself and
not Penelope has been the victim.&nbsp; Now comes the crisis of
the plot, the conception which so delighted the taste of the
Royal Martyr.&nbsp; Wilding finds himself, as he expresses it,
&lsquo;fitted with a pair of horns of his own making;&rsquo; and
his rage, shame, and base attempts to patch up his own dishonour
by marrying Penelope to Hazard (even at the cost of disgorging
the half of her portion, which he had intended to embezzle)
furnish amusement to the audience to the end of the play; at
last, on Hazard and Penelope coming in married, Wilding is
informed that he has been deceived, and that his wife is
unstained, having arranged with Hazard to keep up the delusion in
order to frighten him into good behaviour; whereupon Mr. Wilding
promises to be a good husband henceforth, and the play ends.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole of this farrago of improbable iniquity
not a single personage has any mark of personal character, or
even of any moral quality, save (in Mrs. Wilding&rsquo;s case)
that of patience under injury.&nbsp; Hazard &lsquo;The
Gamester&rsquo; is chosen as the hero, for what reason it is
impossible to say; he is a mere nonentity, doing nothing which
may distinguish him from any other gamester and blackguard, save
that he is, as we are told,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;A man careless<br />
Of wounds; and though he have not had the luck<br />
To kill so many as another, dares<br />
Fight with all them that have.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He, nevertheless, being in want of money, takes a hundred
pounds from a foolish old city merchant (city merchants are
always fools in the seventeenth century) to let his nephew, young
Barnacle, give him a box on the ear in a tavern, and (after the
young cit has been transformed into an intolerable bully by the
fame so acquired) takes another hundred pounds from the repentant
uncle for kicking the youth back into his native state of
peaceful cowardice.&nbsp; With the exception of some little
humour in these scenes with young Barnacle, the whole play is
thoroughly stupid.&nbsp; We look in vain for anything like a
reflection, a sentiment, even a novel image.&nbsp; Its language,
like its morality, is all but on a level with the laboured
vulgarities of the &lsquo;Relapse&rsquo; or the &lsquo;Provoked
Wife,&rsquo; save that (Shirley being a confessed copier of the
great dramatists of the generation before him) there is enough of
the manner of Fletcher and Ben Jonson kept up to hide, at first
sight, the utter want of anything like their matter; and as one
sickens at the rakish swagger and the artificial smartness of his
coxcombs, one regrets the racy and unaffected blackguardism of
the earlier poets&rsquo; men.</p>
<p>This, forsooth, is the best comedy which Charles had heard for
seven years, and the plot, which he himself furnished for the
occasion, fitted to an English audience by a Romish convert.</p>
<p>And yet there is one dramatist of that fallen generation over
whose memory one cannot but linger, fancying what he would have
become, and wondering why so great a spirit was checked suddenly
ere half developed by a fever which carried him off, with several
other Oxford worthies, in 1643, when he was at most thirty-two
(and according to one account only twenty-eight) years old.&nbsp;
Let which of the two dates be the true one, Cartwright must
always rank among our wondrous youths by the side of Prince
Henry, the Admirable Crichton, and others, of whom one&rsquo;s
only doubt is, whether they were not too wondrous, too
precociously complete for future development.&nbsp; We find Dr.
Fell, some time Bishop of Oxford, saying that &lsquo;Cartwright
was the utmost man could come to&rsquo;; we read how his body was
as handsome as his soul; how he was an expert linguist, not only
in Greek and Latin, but in French and Italian, an excellent
orator, admirable poet; how Aristotle was no less known to him
than Cicero and Virgil, and his metaphysical lectures preferred
to those of all his predecessors, the Bishop of Lincoln only
excepted; and his sermons as much admired as his other
composures; and how one fitly applied to him that saying of
Aristotle concerning &OElig;schron the poet, that &lsquo;he could
not tell what &OElig;schron could not do.&rsquo;&nbsp; We find
pages on pages of high-flown epitaphs and sonnets on him, in
which the exceeding bad taste of his admirers makes one inclined
to doubt the taste of him whom they so bedaub with praise; and
certainly, in spite of all due admiration for the Crichton of
Oxford, one is unable to endorse Mr. Jasper Mayne&rsquo;s
opinion, that</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;In thee Ben Jonson still held
Shakspeare&rsquo;s style&rsquo;;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or that he possest</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Lucan&rsquo;s bold heights match&rsquo;d to
staid Virgil&rsquo;s care,<br />
Martial&rsquo;s quick salt, joined to Mus&aelig;us&rsquo;
tongue.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This superabundance of eulogy, when we remember the men and
the age from which it comes, tempts one to form such a conception
of Cartwright as, indeed, the portrait prefixed to his works (ed.
1651) gives us; the offspring of an over-educated and pedantic
age, highly stored with everything but strength and simplicity;
one in whom genius has been rather shaped (perhaps cramped) than
developed: but genius was present, without a doubt, under
whatsoever artificial trappings; and Ben Jonson spoke but truth
when he said, &lsquo;My son Cartwright writes all like a
man.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is impossible to open a page of &lsquo;The
Lady Errant,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Royal Slave,&rsquo; &lsquo;The
Ordinary,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Convert,&rsquo; without
feeling at once that we have to do with a man of a very different
stamp from any (Massinger perhaps alone excepted) who was writing
between 1630 and 1640.&nbsp; The specific gravity of the poems,
so to speak, is far greater than that of any of his
contemporaries; everywhere is thought, fancy, force, varied
learning.&nbsp; He is never weak or dull; though he fails often
enough, is often enough wrong-headed, fantastical, affected, and
has never laid bare the deeper arteries of humanity, for good or
for evil.&nbsp; Neither is he altogether an original thinker; as
one would expect, he has over-read himself: but then he has done
so to good purpose.&nbsp; If he imitates, he generally
equals.&nbsp; The table of fare in &lsquo;The Ordinary&rsquo;
smacks of Rabelais or Aristophanes: but then it is worthy of
either; and if one cannot help suspecting that &lsquo;The
Ordinary&rsquo; never would have been written had not Ben Jonson
written &lsquo;The Alchemist,&rsquo; one confesses that Ben
Jonson need not have been ashamed to have written the play
himself: although the plot, as all Cartwright&rsquo;s are, is
somewhat confused and inconsequent.&nbsp; If he be Platonically
sentimental in &lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Convert,&rsquo; his sentiment
is of the noblest and the purest; and the confest moral of the
play is one which that age needed, if ever age on earth did.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis the good
man&rsquo;s office<br />
To serve and reverence woman, as it is<br />
The fire&rsquo;s to burn; for as our souls consist<br />
Of sense and reason, so do yours, more noble,<br />
Of sense and love, which doth as easily calm<br />
All your desires, as reason quiets ours. . . .<br />
Love, then, doth work in you, what Reason doth<br />
In us; here only lies the difference,&mdash;<br />
Ours wait the lingering steps of Age and Time;<br />
But the woman&rsquo;s soul is ripe when it is young;<br />
So that in us what we call learning, is<br />
Divinity in you, whose operations,<br />
Impatient of delay, do outstrip time.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the sake of such words, in the midst of an evil and
adulterous generation, we will love young Cartwright, in spite of
the suspicion that, addressed as the play is to Charles, and
probably acted before his queen, the young rogue had been playing
the courtier somewhat, and racking his brains for pretty sayings
which would exhibit as a virtue that very uxoriousness of the
poor king which at last cost him his head.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Royal
Slave,&rsquo; too, is a gallant play, right-hearted and lofty
from beginning to end, though enacted in an impossible
court-cloud-world, akin to that in which the classic heroes and
heroines of Corneille and Racine call each other Monsieur and
Madame.</p>
<p>As for his humour; he, alas! can be dirty like the rest, when
necessary: but humour he has of the highest quality.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The Ordinary&rsquo; is full of it; and Moth, the
Antiquary, though too much of a lay figure, and depending for his
amusingness on his quaint antiquated language, is such a sketch
as Mr. Dickens need not have been ashamed to draw.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Royal Slave&rsquo; seems to have been considered,
both by the Court and by his contemporaries, his
masterpiece.&nbsp; And justly so; yet our pleasure at
Charles&rsquo;s having shown, for once, good taste, is somewhat
marred by Langbaine&rsquo;s story, that the good acting of the
Oxford scholars, &lsquo;stately scenes, and richness of the
Persian habits,&rsquo; had as much to do with the success of the
play as its &lsquo;stately style,&rsquo; and &lsquo;the
excellency of the songs, which were set by that admirable
composer, Mr. Henry James.&rsquo;&nbsp; True it is, that the
songs are excellent, as are all Cartwright&rsquo;s; for grace,
simplicity, and sweetness, equal to any (save Shakspeare&rsquo;s)
which the seventeenth century produced: but curiously enough, his
lyric faculty seems to have exhausted itself in these half-dozen
songs.&nbsp; His minor poems are utterly worthless, out Cowleying
Cowley in frigid and fantastic conceits; and his varied addresses
to the king and queen are as bombastic and stupid and artificial
as anything which bedizened the reigns of Charles II. or his
brother.</p>
<p>Are we to gather from this fact that Cartwright was not really
an original genius, but only a magnificent imitator; that he
could write plays well, because others had written them well
already, but only for that reason; and that for the same reason,
when he attempted detached lyrics and addresses, he could only
follow the abominable models which he saw around him?&nbsp; We
know not; for surely in Jonson and Shakspeare&rsquo;s minor poems
he might have found simpler and sweeter types; and even in those
of Fletcher, who appears, from his own account, to have been his
especial pattern.&nbsp; Shakspeare however, as we have seen, he
looked down on; as did the rest of his generation.</p>
<p>Cartwright, as an Oxford scholar, is of course a worshipper of
Charles, and a hater of Puritans.&nbsp; We do not wish to raise a
prejudice against so young a man by quoting any of the
ridiculous, and often somewhat abject, rant with which he
addresses their majesties on their return from Scotland, on the
queen&rsquo;s delivery, on the birth of the Duke of York, and so
forth; for in that he did but copy the tone of grave divines and
pious prelates; but he, unfortunately for his fame, is given (as
young geniuses are sometimes) to prophecy; and two of his
prophecies, at least, have hardly been fulfilled.&nbsp; He was
somewhat mistaken when, on the birth of the Duke of York, he
informed the world that</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The state is now past fear; and all that
we<br />
Need wish besides is perpetuity&rsquo;;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and after indulging in various explanations of the reason why
&lsquo;Nature&rsquo; showed no prodigies at the birth of the
future patron of Judge Jeffreys, which, if he did not believe
them, are lies, and if he did, are very like blasphemies,
declares that the infant is</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;A son of Mirth,<br />
Of Peace and Friendship; &rsquo;tis a quiet birth.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor, again, if spirits in the other world have knowledge of
human affairs, can Mr. Cartwright be now altogether satisfied
with his rogue&rsquo;s augury as to the capacities of the New
England Puritans, when he intends to pick pockets in the New
World, having made the Old too hot to hold him&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;They are good silly people; souls that
will<br />
Be cheated without trouble: one eye is<br />
Put out with zeal, th&rsquo; other with ignorance,<br />
And yet they think they&rsquo;re eagles.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatsoever were the faults of the Pilgrim Fathers (and they
were many), silliness was certainly not among them.&nbsp; But
such was the court fashion.&nbsp; Any insult, however shallow,
ribald, and doggrel (and all these terms are just of the
mock-Puritan ballad which Sir Christopher sings in &lsquo;The
Ordinary,&rsquo; just after an epithalamium so graceful and
melodious, though a little warm in tone, as to be really out of
place in such a fellow&rsquo;s mouth), passes current against men
who were abroad the founders of the United States, and the
forefathers of the acutest and most enterprising nation on earth;
and who at home proved themselves, by terrible fact, not only the
physically stronger party, but the more cunning.&nbsp; But so it
was fated to be.&nbsp; A deep mist of conceit, fed by the shallow
breath of parasites, players, and pedants, wrapt that unhappy
court in blind security, till &lsquo;the breaking was as the
swelling out of a high wall, which cometh suddenly in an
instant.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>But, after all, what Poetry and Art there was in that day,
good or bad, all belonged to the Royalists.</p>
<p>All?&nbsp; There are those who think that, if mere concettism
be a part of poetry, Quarles is as great a poet as Cowley or
George Herbert, Vaughan or Withers.&nbsp; On this question, and
on the real worth of the seventeenth century lyrists, a great
deal has to be said hereafter.&nbsp; Meanwhile, there are those,
too, who believe John Bunyan, considered simply as an artist, to
be the greatest dramatic author whom England has seen since
Shakspeare; and there linger, too, in the libraries and the ears
of men, words of one John Milton.&nbsp; He was no rigid hater of
the beautiful, merely because it was heathen and Popish; no more,
indeed, were many highly-educated and highly-born gentlemen of
the Long Parliament: no more was Cromwell himself, whose delight
was (if we may trust that double renegade Waller) to talk over
with him the worthies of Rome and Greece, and who is said to have
preserved for the nation Raphael&rsquo;s cartoons and Andrea
Mantegna&rsquo;s triumph when Charles&rsquo;s pictures were
sold.&nbsp; But Milton had steeped his whole soul in
romance.&nbsp; He had felt the beauty and glory of the chivalrous
Middle Age as deeply as Shakspeare himself: he had as much
classical lore as any Oxford pedant.&nbsp; He felt to his
heart&rsquo;s core (for he sang of it, and had he not felt it he
would only have written of it) the magnificence and worth of
really high art, of the drama when it was worthy of man and of
itself.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Of gorgeous tragedy,<br />
Presenting Thebes&rsquo; or Pelops&rsquo; line,<br />
Or the Tale of Troy divine,<br />
Or what, though rare, of later age,<br />
Ennobled hath the buskin&rsquo;d stage.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No poet, perhaps, shows wider and truer sympathy with every
form of the really beautiful in art, nature, and history: and yet
he was a Puritan.</p>
<p>Yes, Milton was a Puritan; one who, instead of trusting
himself and his hopes of the universe to second-hand hearsays,
systems, and traditions, had looked God&rsquo;s Word and his own
soul in the face, and determined to act on that which he had
found.&nbsp; And therefore it is that to open his works at any
stray page, after these effeminate Carolists, is like falling
asleep in a stifling city drawing-room, amid Rococo French
furniture, not without untidy traces of last night&rsquo;s ball,
and awaking in an Alpine valley, amid the scent of sweet
cyclamens and pine boughs, to the music of trickling rivulets and
shouting hunters, beneath the dark cathedral aisles of mighty
trees, and here and there, above them and beyond, the spotless
peaks of everlasting snow; while far beneath your feet&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The hemisphere of earth, in clearest
ken,<br />
Stretched to the amplest reach of prospect, lies.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take any&mdash;the most hackneyed passage of
&lsquo;Comus,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Allegro,&rsquo; the
&lsquo;Penseroso,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Paradise Lost,&rsquo; and see
the freshness, the sweetness, the simplicity which is strangely
combined with the pomp, the self-restraint, the earnestness of
every word; take him even, as an <i>experimentum crucis</i>, when
he trenches upon ground heathen and questionable, and tries the
court poets at their own weapons&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Or whether (as some sager sing),<br />
The frolic wind that breathes the spring,<br />
Zephyr, with Aurora playing,<br />
As he met her once a-Maying,<br />
There on beds of violets blue,<br />
And fresh-blown roses washed in dew&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but why quote what all the world knows?&mdash;where shall we
find such real mirth, ease, sweetness, dance and song of words in
anything written for five and twenty years before him?&nbsp;
True, he was no great dramatist.&nbsp; He never tried to be one;
but there was no one in his generation who could have written
either &lsquo;Comus&rsquo; or &lsquo;Samson
Agonistes.&rsquo;&nbsp; And if, as is commonly believed, and as
his countenance seems to indicate, he was deficient in humour, so
were his contemporaries, with the sole exception of
Cartwright.&nbsp; Witty he could be, and bitter; but he did not
live in a really humorous age: and if he has none of the
rollicking fun of the foxhound puppy, at least he has none of the
obscene gibber of the ape.</p>
<p>After all, the great fact stands, that the only lasting poet
of that generation was a Puritan; one who, if he did not write
dramas in sport, at least acted dramas in earnest.&nbsp; For
drama means, etymologically, action and doing: and of the drama
there are, and always will be, two kinds: one the representative,
the other the actual; and for a world wherein there is no
superabundance of good deeds, the latter will be always the
better kind.&nbsp; It is good to represent heroical action in
verse, and on the stage: it is good to &lsquo;purify,&rsquo; as
old Aristotle has it, &lsquo;the affections by pity and
terror.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is an ideal tragedy, and an ideal
comedy also, which one can imagine as an integral part of the
highest Christian civilisation.&nbsp; But when
&lsquo;Christian&rsquo; tragedy sinks below the standard of
heathen Greek tragedy; when, instead of setting forth heroical
deeds, it teaches the audience new possibilities of crime, and
new excuses for those crimes; when, instead of purifying the
affections by pity and terror, it confounds the moral sense by
exciting pity and terror merely for the sake of excitement,
careless whether they be well or ill directed: then it is of the
devil, and the sooner it returns to its father the better for
mankind.&nbsp; When, again, comedy, instead of stirring a divine
scorn of baseness, or even a kindly and indulgent smile at the
weaknesses and oddities of humanity, learns to make a mock of
sin,&mdash;to find excuses for the popular frailties which it
pretends to expose,&mdash;then it also is of the devil, and to
the devil let it go; while honest and earnest men, who have no
such exceeding love of &lsquo;Art&rsquo; that they must needs
have bad art rather than none at all, do the duty which lies
nearest them amid clean whitewash and honest prose.&nbsp; The
whole theory of &lsquo;Art, its dignity and vocation,&rsquo;
seems to us at times questionable, if coarse facts are to be
allowed to weigh (as we suppose they are) against delicate
theories.&nbsp; If we are to judge by the example of Italy, the
country which has been most of all devoted to the practice of
&lsquo;Art,&rsquo; then a nation is not necessarily free, strong,
moral, or happy because it can &lsquo;represent&rsquo; facts, or
can understand how other people have represented them.&nbsp; We
do not hesitate to go farther, and to say that the now past
weakness of Germany was to be traced in a great degree to that
pernicious habit of mind which made her educated men fancy it
enough to represent noble thoughts and feelings, or to analyse
the representations of them: while they did not bestir
themselves, or dream that there was a moral need for bestirring
themselves, toward putting these thoughts and feelings into
practice.&nbsp; Goethe herein was indeed the type of a very large
class of Germans: God grant that no generation may ever see such
a type common in England; and that our race, remembering ever
that the golden age of the English drama was one of private
immorality, public hypocrisy, ecclesiastical pedantry, and regal
tyranny, and ended in the temporary downfall of Church and Crown,
may be more ready to do fine things than to write fine books; and
act in their lives, as those old Puritans did, a drama which
their descendants may be glad to put on paper for them long after
they are dead.</p>
<p>For surely these Puritans were dramatic enough, poetic enough,
picturesque enough.&nbsp; We do not speak of such fanatics as
Balfour of Burley, or any other extravagant person whom it may
have suited Walter Scott to take as a typical personage.&nbsp; We
speak of the average Puritan nobleman, gentleman, merchant, or
farmer; and hold him to have been a picturesque and poetical
man,&mdash;a man of higher imagination and deeper feeling than
the average of court poets; and a man of sound taste also.&nbsp;
What is to be said for his opinions about the stage has been seen
already: but it seems to have escaped most persons&rsquo; notice,
that either all England is grown very foolish, or the Puritan
opinions on several matters have been justified by time.</p>
<p>On the matter of the stage, the world has certainly come over
to their way of thinking.&nbsp; Few highly educated men now think
it worth while to go to see any play, and that exactly for the
same reasons as the Puritans put forward; and still fewer highly
educated men think it worth while to write plays: finding that
since the grosser excitements of the imagination have become
forbidden themes, there is really very little to write about.</p>
<p>But in the matter of dress and of manners, the Puritan triumph
has been complete.&nbsp; Even their worst enemies have come over
to their side, and the &lsquo;whirligig of time has brought about
its revenge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Most of their canons of taste have become those of all
England.&nbsp; High Churchmen, who still call them Roundheads and
Cropped-ears, go about rounder-headed and closer cropt than they
ever went.&nbsp; They held it more rational to cut the hair to a
comfortable length than to wear effeminate curls down the
back.&nbsp; We cut ours much shorter than they ever did.&nbsp;
They held (with the Spaniards, then the finest gentlemen in the
world) that sad, <i>i.e.</i> dark colours, above all black, were
the fittest for all stately and earnest gentlemen.&nbsp; We all,
from the Tractarian to the Anythingarian, are exactly of the same
opinion.&nbsp; They held that lace, perfumes, and jewellery on a
man were marks of unmanly foppishness and vanity.&nbsp; So hold
the finest gentlemen in England now.&nbsp; They thought it
equally absurd and sinful for a man to carry his income on his
back, and bedizen himself out in reds, blues, and greens,
ribbons, knots, slashes, and treble quadruple d&aelig;dalian
ruffs, built up on iron and timber, which have more arches in
them for pride than London Bridge for use.&nbsp; We, if we met
such a ruffed and ruffled worthy as used to swagger by dozens up
and down Paul&rsquo;s Walk, not knowing how to get a dinner, much
less to pay his tailor, should look on him as firstly a fool, and
secondly a swindler: while if we met an old Puritan, we should
consider him a man gracefully and picturesquely drest, but withal
in the most perfect sobriety of good taste; and when we
discovered (as we probably should), over and above, that the
harlequin cavalier had a box of salve and a pair of dice in one
pocket, a pack of cards and a few pawnbroker&rsquo;s duplicates
in the other; that his thoughts were altogether of
citizens&rsquo; wives and their too easy virtue; and that he
could not open his mouth without a dozen oaths: then we should
consider the Puritan (even though he did quote Scripture somewhat
through his nose) as the gentleman; and the courtier as a most
offensive specimen of the &lsquo;snob triumphant,&rsquo; glorying
in his shame.&nbsp; The picture is not ours, nor even the
Puritan&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It is Bishop Hall&rsquo;s, Bishop
Earle&rsquo;s, it is Beaumont&rsquo;s, Fletcher&rsquo;s,
Jonson&rsquo;s, Shakspeare&rsquo;s,&mdash;the picture which every
dramatist, as well as satirist, has drawn of the
&lsquo;gallant&rsquo; of the seventeenth century.&nbsp; No one
can read those writers honestly without seeing that the Puritan,
and not the Cavalier conception of what a British gentleman
should be, is the one accepted by the whole nation at this
day.</p>
<p>In applying the same canon to the dress of women they were
wrong.&nbsp; As in other matters, they had hold of one pole of a
double truth, and erred in applying it exclusively to all
cases.&nbsp; But there are two things to be said for them; first,
that the dress of that day was palpably an incentive to the
profligacy of that day, and therefore had to be protested
against; while in these more moral times ornaments and fashions
may be harmlessly used which then could not be used without
harm.&nbsp; Next, it is undeniable that sober dressing is more
and more becoming the fashion among well-bred women; and that
among them, too, the Puritan canons are gaining ground.</p>
<p>We have just said that the Puritans held too exclusively to
one pole of a double truth.&nbsp; They did so, no doubt, in their
hatred of the drama.&nbsp; Their belief that human relations
were, if not exactly sinful, at least altogether carnal and
unspiritual, prevented their conceiving the possibility of any
truly Christian drama; and led them at times into strange and sad
errors, like that New England ukase of Cotton Mather&rsquo;s, who
is said to have punished the woman who should kiss her infant on
the Sabbath day.&nbsp; Yet their extravagances on this point were
but the honest revulsion from other extravagances on the opposite
side.&nbsp; If the undistinguishing and immoral Autotheism of the
playwrights, and the luxury and heathendom of the higher classes,
first in Italy and then in England, were the natural revolt of
the human mind against the Manich&aelig;ism of monkery: then the
severity and exclusiveness of Puritanism was a natural and
necessary revolt against that luxury and immorality; a protest
for man&rsquo;s God-given superiority over nature, against that
Naturalism which threatened to end in sheer animalism.&nbsp;
While Italian prelates have found an apologist in Mr. Roscoe, and
English playwrights in Mr. Gifford, the old Puritans, who felt
and asserted, however extravagantly, that there was an eternal
law which was above all Borgias and Machiavels, Stuarts and
Fletchers, have surely a right to a fair trial.&nbsp; If they
went too far in their contempt for humanity, certainly no one
interfered to set them right.&nbsp; The Anglicans of that time,
who held intrinsically the same anthropologic notions, and yet
wanted the courage and sincerity to carry them out as honestly,
neither could nor would throw any light upon the controversy; and
the only class who sided with the poor playwrights in asserting
that there were more things in man, and more excuses for man,
than were dreamt of in Prynne&rsquo;s philosophy, were the Jesuit
Casuists, who, by a fatal perverseness, used all their little
knowledge of human nature to the same undesirable purpose as the
playwrights; namely, to prove how it was possible to commit every
conceivable sinful action without sinning.&nbsp; No wonder that
in an age in which courtiers and theatre-haunters were turning
Romanists by the dozen, and the priest-ridden queen was the chief
patroness of the theatre, the Puritans should have classed
players and Jesuits in the same category, and deduced the
parentage of both alike from the father of lies.</p>
<p>But as for these Puritans having been merely the sour, narrow,
inhuman persons they are vulgarly supposed to have been,
<i>credat Jud&aelig;us</i>.&nbsp; There were sour and narrow men
among them; so there were in the opposite party.&nbsp; No Puritan
could have had less poetry in him, less taste, less feeling, than
Laud himself.&nbsp; But is there no poetry save words?&nbsp; No
drama save that which is presented on the stage?&nbsp; Is this
glorious earth, and the souls of living men, mere prose, as long
as &lsquo;<i>carent vate sacro</i>,&rsquo; who will, forsooth, do
them the honour to make poetry out of a little of them (and of
how little!) by translating them into words, which he himself,
just in proportion as he is a good poet, will confess to be
clumsy, tawdry, ineffectual?&nbsp; Was there no poetry in these
Puritans because they wrote no poetry?&nbsp; We do not mean now
the unwritten tragedy of the battle-psalm and the charge; but
simple idyllic poetry and quiet home-drama, love-poetry of the
heart and the hearth, and the beauties of everyday human
life.&nbsp; Take the most commonplace of them: was Zeal-for-Truth
Thoresby, of Thoresby Rise in Deeping Fen, because his father had
thought fit to give him an ugly and silly name, the less of a
noble lad?&nbsp; Did his name prevent his being six feet
high?&nbsp; Were his shoulders the less broad for it, his cheeks
the less ruddy for it?&nbsp; He wore his flaxen hair of the same
length that every one now wears theirs, instead of letting it
hang half-way to his waist in essenced curls; but was he
therefore the less of a true Viking&rsquo;s son, bold-hearted as
his sea-roving ancestors who won the Danelagh by Canute&rsquo;s
side, and settled there on Thoresby Rise, to grow wheat and breed
horses, generation succeeding generation, in the old moated
grange?&nbsp; He carried a Bible in his jack-boot: but did that
prevent him, as Oliver rode past him with an approving smile on
Naseby field, thinking himself a very handsome fellow, with his
moustache and imperial, and bright red coat, and cuirass well
polished, in spite of many a dint, as he sate his father&rsquo;s
great black horse as gracefully and firmly as any long-locked and
essenced cavalier in front of him?&nbsp; Or did it prevent him
thinking, too, for a moment, with a throb of the heart, that
sweet Cousin Patience far away at home, could she but see him,
might have the same opinion of him as he had of himself?&nbsp;
Was he the worse for the thought?&nbsp; He was certainly not the
worse for checking it the next instant, with manly shame for
letting such &lsquo;carnal vanities&rsquo; rise in his heart
while he was &lsquo;doing the Lord&rsquo;s work&rsquo; in the
teeth of death and hell: but was there no poetry in him
then?&nbsp; No poetry in him, five minutes later, as the long
rapier swung round his head, redder and redder at every
sweep?&nbsp; We are befooled by names.&nbsp; Call him Crusader
instead of Roundhead, and he seems at once (granting him only
sincerity, which he had, and that of a right awful kind) as
complete a knight-errant as ever watched and prayed, ere putting
on his spurs, in fantastic Gothic chapel, beneath &lsquo;storied
windows richly dight.&rsquo;&nbsp; Was there no poetry in him,
either, half an hour afterwards, as he lay bleeding across the
corpse of the gallant horse, waiting for his turn with the
surgeon, and fumbled for the Bible in his boot, and tried to hum
a psalm, and thought of Cousin Patience, and his father, and his
mother, and how they would hear, at least, that he had played the
man in Israel that day, and resisted unto blood, striving against
sin and the Man of Sin?</p>
<p>And was there no poetry in him, too, as he came wearied along
Thoresby dyke, in the quiet autumn eve, home to the house of his
forefathers, and saw afar off the knot of tall poplars rising
over the broad misty flat, and the one great abele tossing its
sheets of silver in the dying gusts; and knew that they stood
before his father&rsquo;s door?&nbsp; Who can tell all the pretty
child-memories which flitted across his brain at that sight, and
made him forget that he was a wounded cripple?&nbsp; There is the
dyke where he and his brothers snared the great pike which stole
the ducklings&mdash;how many years ago?&mdash;while pretty little
Patience stood by trembling, and shrieked at each snap of the
brute&rsquo;s wide jaws; and there, down that long dark lode,
ruffling with crimson in the sunset breeze, he and his brothers
skated home in triumph with Patience when his uncle died.&nbsp;
What a day that was! when, in the clear bright winter noon, they
laid the gate upon the ice, and tied the beef-bones under the
four corners, and packed little Patience on it.&nbsp; How pretty
she looked, though her eyes were red with weeping, as she peeped
out from among the heap of blankets and horse-hides; and how
merrily their long fen-runners whistled along the ice-lane,
between the high banks of sighing reed, as they towed home their
new treasure in triumph, at a pace like the race-horse&rsquo;s,
to the dear old home among the poplar-trees.&nbsp; And now he was
going home to meet her, after a mighty victory, a deliverance
from heaven, second only in his eyes to that Red Sea one.&nbsp;
Was there no poetry in his heart at that thought?&nbsp; Did not
the glowing sunset, and the reed-beds which it transfigured
before him into sheets of golden flame, seem tokens that the
glory of God was going before him in his path?&nbsp; Did not the
sweet clamour of the wild-fowl, gathering for one rich p&aelig;an
ere they sank into rest, seem to him as God&rsquo;s bells chiming
him home in triumph, with peels sweeter and bolder than those of
Lincoln or Peterborough steeple-house?&nbsp; Did not the very
lapwing, as she tumbled, softly wailing, before him, as she did
years ago, seem to welcome the wanderer home in the name of
heaven?</p>
<p>Fair Patience, too, though she was a Puritan; yet did not her
cheek flush, her eye grow dim, like any other girl&rsquo;s, as
she saw far off the red coat, like a sliding spark of fire,
coming slowly along the strait fen-bank, and fled upstairs into
her chamber to pray, half that it might be, half that it might
not be he?&nbsp; Was there no happy storm of human tears and
human laughter when he entered the courtyard gate?&nbsp; Did not
the old dog lick his Puritan hand as lovingly as if it had been a
Cavalier&rsquo;s?&nbsp; Did not lads and lasses run out
shouting?&nbsp; Did not the old yeoman father hug him, weep over
him, hold him at arm&rsquo;s length, and hug him again, as
heartily as any other John Bull, even though the next moment he
called all to kneel down and thank Him who had sent his boy home
again, after bestowing on him the grace to bind kings in chains
and nobles with links of iron, and contend to death for the faith
delivered to the saints?&nbsp; And did not Zeal-for-Truth look
about as wistfully for Patience as any other man would have done,
longing to see her, yet not daring even to ask for her?&nbsp; And
when she came down at last, was she the less lovely in his eyes
because she came, not flaunting with bare bosom, in tawdry finery
and paint, but shrouded close in coif and pinner, hiding from all
the world beauty which was there still, but was meant for one
alone, and that only if God willed, in God&rsquo;s good
time?&nbsp; And was there no faltering of their voices, no light
in their eyes, no trembling pressure of their hands, which said
more, and was more, ay, and more beautiful in the sight of Him
who made them, than all Herrick&rsquo;s Dianemes, Waller&rsquo;s
Saccharissas, flames, darts, posies, love-knots, anagrams, and
the rest of the insincere cant of the court?&nbsp; What if
Zeal-for-Truth had never strung two rhymes together in his
life?&nbsp; Did not his heart go for inspiration to a loftier
Helicon when it whispered to itself, &lsquo;My love, my dove, my
undefiled, is but one,&rsquo; than if he had filled pages with
sonnets about Venuses and Cupids, lovesick shepherds and cruel
nymphs?</p>
<p>And was there no poetry, true idyllic poetry, as of
Longfellow&rsquo;s &lsquo;Evangeline&rsquo; itself in that trip
round the old farm next morning; when Zeal-for-Truth, after
looking over every heifer, and peeping into every sty, would
needs canter down by his father&rsquo;s side to the horse-fen,
with his arm in a sling; while the partridges whirred up before
them, and the lurchers flashed like gray snakes after the hare,
and the colts came whinnying round, with staring eyes and
streaming manes; and the two chatted on in the same sober
businesslike English tone, alternately of &lsquo;The Lord&rsquo;s
great dealings&rsquo; by General Cromwell, the pride of all
honest fen-men, and the price of troop-horses at the next
Horncastle fair?</p>
<p>Poetry in those old Puritans?&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; They were
men of like passions with ourselves.&nbsp; They loved, they
married, they brought up children; they feared, they sinned, they
sorrowed, they fought&mdash;they conquered.&nbsp; There was
poetry enough in them, be sure, though they acted it like men,
instead of singing it like birds.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
